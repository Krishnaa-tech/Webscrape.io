INDIA NEWS,India denies 'secret memo against Nijjar' report: 'Peddled by Pak intelligence',https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-denies-secret-memo-against-nijjar-report-peddled-by-pak-intelligence-101702229753576.html,"The ministry of external affairs on Sunday denied a report on Hardeep Singh Nijjar that claimed that New Delhi sent a 'secret memo' to consulates in North America to launch a ""sophisticated crackdown scheme"" against Sikh diaspora organisations in Western countries. Calling the report by The Intercept fake and completely fabricated, the ministry said there was no such memo. ""This is part of a sustained disinformation campaign against India. The outlet in question is known for propagating fake narratives peddled by Pakistani intelligence. The posts of the authors confirm this linkage,"" the MEA said. ""Those who amplify such fake news only do so at the cost of their own credibility,"" the statement read.
The Intercept report claimed that a secret memo was issued in April 2023. It ""lists several Sikh dissidents under investigation by India's intelligence agencies including the Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar"", the report termed fake by the government read. It claimed the memo was sent two months before Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed in Vancouver.
India-Canada relationship received a jolt after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that India was behind Hardeep Singh Nijjar's assassination. India rejected the claim and assured that it would cooperate in the investigation process if Canada provided evidence. There was a diplomatic row between the two countries and India temporarily suspended its visa services in Canada. The services resumed but Ottawa had to withdraw around 40 diplomats from India as New Delhi pointed out a disparity in the number of diplomats between India and Canada. India also accused Canadian diplomats posted in India of interfering in internal affairs.

“I have discharged whatever responsibilities given by the party to me, and I am confident that this time also, I will discharge the new challenging responsibility in a similar way,” he added.
When asked whether his appointment to the top post will benefit the party in adjoining tribal-dominated states like Odisha and Jharkhand, Sai said tribals of the country are associated with BJP as they very well know that it is their only well-wisher party.
“Honourable Droupadi Murmu ji, who comes from a tribal community, became the President of the country in the BJP regime. A separate tribal development ministry was formed when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was at the Centre. Vajpayee ji was also the founder of Chhattisgarh,"" he said.

Tribals are well aware that under the BJP rule, their development, well-being, and respect are achievable, he said.
Later, Sai went to Jai Stambh Chowk in the capital and paid respect to the statue of Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh, a freedom fighter from the tribal community.
“Today is the death anniversary of Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh and therefore, I have come to pay tribute to him,” he told reporters.
“BJP takes care of the tribal community. I should not say this today but the Congress treats tribals as their vote bank…” he claimed.
Subsequently, he went to his residence in Vidhayak Colony here where he was given a warm welcome by his family members and party workers.

Attacking the parties, Amit Shah said, “I understand Congress is silent as corruption is in their nature but JDU, RJD, DMK, and SP all are sitting silently...Now I understand why a campaign was run against PM Modi that agencies are being misused. It was run because there was a fear in their mind that all the secrets of their corruption would be revealed.”

Meanwhile, the Congress distanced itself from the matter as Congress leader and Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta clarified that his party had no involvement in the matter under discussion. The minister said that it was the responsibility of the central agency to clarify where the money came from.
""Dhiraj Sahu belongs to a big family, which has business interests. They have been running their businesses for several years. I believe it is the Income Tax department that should come out with a detailed clarification on the source of the money,"" Gupta told ANI.
""It's not that he had stashed bribe money. An investigation is underway after which everything will be crystal clear. However, is his (Sahu's) personal business and has nothing to do with the party,"" the minister added.
The income tax department has recovered an amount of ₹353 crore at premises linked to Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu. Cash counting is currently underway at the main branch of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, Odisha.

A total of nine meetings have been held so far this year, which includes four meetings of Zonal Councils and five meetings of standing committees.

These include eliminating malnutrition among children through the Poshan Abhiyan (nutrition campaign), reducing the dropout rate of schoolchildren, and operationalizing Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for speedy investigation and speedy disposal of rape cases against women and children. The facility of banks and Indian Post Payment Bank branches within 5 km of each village, the formation of two lakh new primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) in the country and the strengthening of all existing PACS in the country have also been included.

He said the governor also approved the bill. He added that there are some issues regarding caste-based surveys, which he hoped the state government would resolve. Shri Shah said that the Central government never had any intention of creating hurdles in the caste-based survey.

INDIA NEWS,Dhiraj Sahu I-T raid: Cash haul reaches ₹353 cr; MP's old tweet viral,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhiraj-sahu-i-t-raid-cash-counting-ends-with-seizure-of-rs-353-cr-mps-old-tweet-emerges-101702222617833.html,"The amount of unaccounted cash found from premises linked to Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu reached ₹353 crore on Sunday as the counting finally came to an end while the issue snowballed into a major political controversy because of the involvement of the Congress MP. The income tax department raided the premises on Wednesday and found stacks of notes kept in almirah racks. The counting began but could not be finished in a day or two as the SBI branch where the notes were being counted had its normal operations too. The counting could be completed by the weekend, the staff said earlier.
The I-T raids were at the premises of Boudh Distilleries Private Limited across Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Neither the MP nor the company has issued any statement so far. The Congress said the party has no involvement in the MP's business and he should explain this huge amount of cash.
The counting created a spectacle as this became the largest cash haul in a single operation in the country. The SBI branch where the counting took place received 176 bags full of cash. Three banks were roped in for the counting process. 40 currency counting machines were brought in. Initially, there was a shortage of machines as the ones in the counting operation gave in.
The counting involved nine teams of about 80 people from the tax department and various banks and they worked 24X7 in shifts. After 10 cash-stuffed almirahs were found, another team of 200 officials, including security personnel, drivers and other staff, joined in.
BJP's Amit Malviya shared a screenshot of Dhiraj Sahu's old tweet in which he exclaimed how there still was so much black money in the country even after demonetisation. ""Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has a dark sense of humour,"" Malviya tweeed.


""I feel pained seeing so much corruption and black money in the country even after noteban. This is beyond my understanding how people can accumulate so much of black money. Only Congress can uproot corruption from the party,"" Dhiraj Prasad Sahu tweeted in 2022.


""Imagine how much one Congress MP has looted that it takes almost an army of personnel to count the loot. Now multiply it with Congress’ 60 years of power & 1000s of MPs. It runs into tens of thousands of crores. Congress is corruption ki beemari! The disease of corruption,"" BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said.


Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday spoke about the issue as he questioned the silence of the INDIA parties like SP, DMK, JDU. ""It can be now understood as to why the allegation against the Modi government that it is misusing investigation agencies was made.It was because of the fear that their corruption will be exposed,"" Amit Shah said. PM Modi too earlier commented on the massive cash haul and said it is PM Modi's guarantee that every penny has to be returned to the public.

The five-judge constitution bench, including Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, and Surya Kant, will deliver the judgment on Monday. The apex court reserved the judgment on September 5 after a 16-day argument session.
Attorney General R Venkataramani, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, and senior advocates Harish Salve, Rakesh Dwivedi, V Giri, and others have represented the Centre and intervenors supporting the abrogation of Article 370.
Senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subramanium, Rajeev Dhavan, Zaffar Shah, Dushyant Dave, and others, presented their case on behalf of the petitioners.
Also read: Ahead of Article 370 verdict, little hope more despair in J&K
Lawyers contested on various issues, including the constitutional validity of the Centre's decision on August 5, 2019, to abrogate Article 370, the validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, challenges to the Governor's and President's rule, and the extension of President's rule in the former state on July 3, 2019.
Numerous petitions challenging the Article 370 abrogation and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which created Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as Union territories, were referred to the Constitution bench in 2019.
During the hearing, the apex court asked who can recommend the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir when no constituent Assembly, the concurrence of which is required before taking such a step, exists there.
Supreme Court also asked how can a provision (Article 370), which was specifically mentioned as temporary in the Constitution, become permanent after the tenure of the Jammu and Kashmir constituent Assembly came to an end in 1957.
The central government said that the abrogation of Article 370 was not a ""constitutional fraud"" and aligned with the legal framework.
It argued that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India was similar to the process followed by numerous princely states. It said many states joined through accession post-independence with conditionalities but after merger, their sovereignty was subsumed into India.
The central government said that Jammu and Kashmir's current status as a Union Territory is temporary and it is committed to restoring statehood.
The government said there is a positive transformation in Jammu and Kashmir, citing a decline in street violence since 2019. It claimed an ""unprecedented era of peace, progress, and prosperity,"" with normalcy returning to the region after years of turmoil.
Also read- Article 370 was a stopgap measure: Centre to SC
Petitioners argued that Article 370, initially considered temporary, became permanent after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir.
They contended that Parliament lacked the authority to declare itself the legislature of J-K for Article 370's abrogation, citing Article 354 as insufficient for such power.
Pointing towards Article 370's clause 3, petitioners said that the Constituent Assembly's recommendation was crucial for its removal. Due to the Constituent Assembly's dissolution, required for abrogating Article 370, petitioners claimed that the provision could not be revoked.
Also read- Ends cannot justify means: SC to Centre on Article 370
The Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association presented in Supreme Court that upon acceding to India, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir retained territorial sovereignty over the state but not the sovereign power to rule and govern.
However, the association said, apart from defence, external affairs, and communication, all other powers were retained by the state for legislation and governance.

INDIA NEWS,"AAP leader Kejriwal, CM Mann launch doorstep delivery of services in Punjab",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-leader-kejriwal-cm-bhagwant-mann-launch-doorstep-delivery-of-services-in-punjab-101702218784851.html,"AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann Sunday launched a state government scheme to deliver citizen-centric services at people's doorstep, with the senior leader calling it a hammer blow on corruption.
Under the ""Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar"" scheme, people will get 43 services, including certificates of birth, marriage, death, income, residence, caste, rural area, border area, backward area, pension, payment of electricity bills and land demarcation.
Addressing a gathering here after the launch of the scheme, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal called it ""revolutionary"".
Lauding the Mann government, Kejriwal said it was taking steps one after another against corruption and is conducting raids against and arresting big leaders who ""looted"" Punjab in the last 75 years.
He said freedom fighters did not sacrifice their lives for people to face harassment at government offices even after freedom.
They sacrificed their lives so that people get good education, quality health, medicines, roads and electricity, said the Delhi CM.
But in the last 75 years, with the kind of system in the country, people face a lot of harassment at government offices for getting even a small work done, he said. ""The work that is going to commence in Punjab is no less than a revolution. It is a revolutionary step,"" said Kejriwal.
He spoke about the plight of people visiting government offices for getting their work done.
They have to stand in long queues, take leaves, skip farm work and even pay money to then middleman to get their work done, he said. ""Today, the work which is going to start in Punjab, you now do not need to go to offices. Your work will be done at your doorsteps,"" he added.
Kejriwal said as many as 43 government services will be delivered at the doorstep, covering around 99 percent services by the state government. He said the day is not far when 100 percent government services will be available to people at their doorsteps.
He said to avail these services, people will have to dial 1076 and they will be then asked to schedule their appointments according to their convenience to get their work done, he said.
He said his government started this service in Delhi in September 2018 and lakhs of people have availed it. ""If the governments of Delhi and Punjab could do this, then why was this work not done by the governments of other parties in the last 75 years. If the Delhi government could do this five years back, why then governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra did not do this till now? Their intention is bad,"" he alleged.
He said the money which people pay to middlemen for getting the work done reaches an officer, a minister and a chief minister. ""Money you pay for birth, death certificates, and ration cards directly reaches up till a chief minister,"" he said.
""You have elected an honest government in Punjab. You have chosen an honest chief minister in Punjab… we do not take money,"" said Kejriwal.
The AAP chief the Mann government was taking successive steps against corruption. ""Big fish were caught. Big leaders who looted money in 75 years, were raided and arrested. He (Mann) is not scared of any one, he is courageous. Whosoever looted Punjab, be it any party, will be put behind bars,"" he said.
Whosoever looted Punjab's money, will be taken back from them and will be spent on people, building schools and hospitals, said Kejriwal.
""The step being taken today is the biggest hammer blow on corruption in Punjab by the Bhagwant Mann government. Coming generations will remember this,"" he said.
Speaking before him, Mann said from now onwards, the inconvenience and humiliation of the common man in the government offices will end forever. He said he and his MLAs will regularly keep a tab on the scheme so that it benefits the common man.
All of them will conduct inspections at the government offices thereby facilitating the common man, said Mann.
Mann said only two or three families ruled the state during the past 25 years and ruin it for their vested personal interests.
These families ran the state as per their own “whims and fancies” just to exploit the people of the state, he said.

I wish that you take forward the journey of justice and progress of Chhattisgarh as the Chief Minister. @vishnudsai”


Vishnu Deo Sai's name was announced as the new chief minister on Sunday. Sai is the first tribal CM of the state. Sai was elected as an MLA from the Kunkuri assembly seat in the state's Surguja division. The BJP won all 14 segments in the region.
After being elected as the new CM of the state, Sai told reporters, “As the chief minister, I will try to fulfil PM Modi's guarantees (pre-poll promises of the BJP) through the government.” He also said that the first work undertaken by him will be that of 'providing 18 lakh homes to the people of Chhattisgarh.

""Judega Bharat, jeetega INDIA,"" the Congress leader posted amid cloud over opposition unity amid skirmish between parties. At this meeting, the opposition bloc wants to work on a theme of unity 'Main nahi, hum', a PTI report said.
West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and former Uttar Pradesh CM and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav indicated their inability to attend the meeting at the date scheduled earlier. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin was also managing the Cyclone Michaung situation in the state.
A section of the alliance asserted that there was no infighting but the leaders were unable to attend the meeting on December 6. However, there were adverse reactions from the regional leaders after the Congress lost Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and failed to defeat the BJP in Madhya Pradesh. Trinamool supremo Mamata Banerjee said the results were not BJP's victory but Congress's failure.
At this meeting, seat-sharing is likely to be discussed which will become a crucial issue for the INDIA bloc. There can be discussion of joint election campaign ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. The last meeting of the 27 alliance partners was held in Mumbai in September in which coordination committees were set up.
The seat-sharing talks among the INDIA partners were stalled as the Congress was anticipating a good result in the three states which could have strengthened its negotiation. In those states, there was no seat-sharing agreement among the opposition parties either.
Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav was miffed as there was no sear-sharing in Madhya Pradesh where the party contested in 69 seats. The party ended up with the worst vote share as it did not even come a close second on any of the seats. On 43 of the 69 seats that the Samajwadi Party contested, it bagged less than 1,000 votes.

The marathon raids against Boudh Distillery Private Limited, its promoters and others entered the fifth day on Sunday. The raids were launched on December 6 by the income tax department on charges of tax evasion and ""off-the-book"" transactions.

Jharkhand Congress chief Avinash Pandey said the party had no links with the issue as it is his personal matter. The BJP, however, called Sahu Rahul Gandhi's ""friend"" and demanded answers from the party.
""Since he is Congress MP, he should make an official statement about how such a big amount of money came to him,"" Pandey said while speaking to media persons at Ranchi's Birsa Munda airport.
""The party has a clear-cut stand that it is a private matter of Dhiraj Sahu, which has nothing to do with the Congress party,"" he added.
He further said the country liquor baron's family has been running the business for over 100 years and the Congress MP was just a part of the business. ""But Sahu should clarify how such a big amount came to him,"" he added.
BJP MLA CP Singh said the Congress wanted to protect Sahu's bosses.
""Is Sahu Congress MP or Independent? If he is an Independent candidate, then he can say that the party has nothing to do,"" he said.

The Bharatiya Janata Party won 115 seats in the 199-strong assembly, relegating the Congress to just 69 seats. The party hasn't yet formed governments in the three states (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) whose elections it won recently.
Vasundhara Raje was the chief minister of Rajasthan when the party last formed a government in the state.
Baba Balak Nath's name had cropped up after the party's win earlier this month. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhary even joked on camera over the speculation. ""Meet the new chief minister of Rajasthan,"" Choudhary said jokingly in Parliament.
Other names rumoured to be considered for the coveted chief ministerial role are Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Diya Kumari.
Outgoing Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot had said the delay in announcing CMs in the three states was because of the lack of discipline within the party.
""There is no discipline in this party. If we had done the same, I don't know what allegations they would have levelled against us and misled people. They polarised the polls... We will cooperate with the new government,"" he said on Saturday.
BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf responded to Gehlot's allegation today saying it took over a fortnight for the Congress to announce its chief minister in 2018.
""For the Congress to level such allegations at us is laughable. After the last Assembly elections in 2018, it took them 16 days to decide their chief minister. Unlike the BJP, which handles these matters in a democratic manner, they are dictatorial. Our party top brass has appointed observers for Rajasthan, who will come here, listen to the MLAs and tender their report to the high command which will eventually decide the CM,"" he said.
Earlier this week, the father of BJP MLA Lalit Meena claimed four new MLAs confined the Kishanganj MLA in a resort. He also named Vasundhara Raje's son Dushyant Singh.
""...I had gone to take him (Lalit Meena) from 'Apano Rajasthan Resort'...Dushyant Singh took him along. Kanwarlal, an MLA, tried to stop me. He asked me to first talk to Dushyant Singh and then take him (Lalit Meena)...A total of five MLAs were there at the resort...,"" Hemraj Meena was quoted by ANI as saying on Thursday.

“Before terming the Congress ‘corrupted’, the BJP should assure the country that these corrupts aren't offered to free themselves from their sins if they join the party in future,” she said acknowledging the Congress MP's action as a practice of “out-and-out tax evasion.”

Sarbananda Sonowal and Arjun Munda are likely to attend a meeting with newly elected legislators regarding the chief ministerial candidate in the state.

Union health minister and BJP's Chhattisgarh co-incharge Mansukh Mandaviya are also in Raipur. The party has been facing criticism for keeping its cards close and delaying the chief minister picks.
The BJP ousted incumbent Congress from Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and retained Madhya Pradesh with a landslide victory. This led to the saffron party tightening its hold in the Hindi heartland and gave a big boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
With an absolute majority in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly, the BJP won 54 seats while the Congress trailed at 35 seats. In Rajasthan, the saffron party won a total of 115 out of 199 seats. In Madhya Pradesh, BJP managed to stave off anti-incumbency after winning 163 seats in the 230-member assembly. However, the BJP bagged only eight seats in the 119-member Telangana assembly as Congress won the southern state by ousting K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). Revanth Reddy of the Congress took oath as the new chief minister of Telangana on Thursday.
While the BJP has not officially announced any names, several top leaders from Chhattisgarh are speculated to be potential candidates for the chief minister post in the states.
Here we take a look at some of them:
From a Rajput family in Chhattisgarh’s Kawardha, 71-year-old Raman Singh is a three-time chief minister who governed the state from 2003 to 2018. A former Union minister, Singh took over after the BJP beat the Ajit Jogi-led Congress in 2003, and quickly became known as “chawal vale baba”, strengthening the state’s public distribution system. He was in power for fifteen straight years before anti-incumbency caught up with him, and the BJP crashed to 15 seats in 2018. Singh however has re-emerged as a key component of the BJP win in the state, and with Lok Sabha elections in 2024, is a steady hand if the party wants to choose stability.
Arun Sao, 54, who began his political career as a volunteer of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, rose to win his first Lok Sabha election from Bilaspur in 2019, and was made state party president in November 2022.
A lawyer by profession and a former deputy advocate general in the BJP tenure. Sao will have credit in the bank after pulling off the unlikeliest of electoral wins among the Hindi heartland states, and may also be in the running because he is a Sahu, the most influential of OBC communities that have moved decisively to the BJP.
A dark horse for the post of chief minister is former IAS officer-turned-politician OP Choudhary, who fought the elections from Raigarh and won with a record margin of 64,000 votes. The 2005-batch officer, who was once the district collector of Dantewada, where he brought in several schemes for the education of children in Bastar, joined the BJP in August 2018.
A “son of the soil”, Choudhary is from the Agharia caste, an influential OBC group in rural Chhattisgarh, and has been seen as a future leader for the BJP. During his campaign, Amit Shah, who took out a roadshow in his constituency of Raigarh said that the people had to make him win, and the responsibility of making him a “big man” was the home minister’s.
Ramvichar Netam has served as a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha from Chhattisgarh from 2016 to 2022. He has formerly served as the cabinet minister in the government of former BJP chief minister Raman Singh.
If the BJP wants to pick a tribal face as its chief minister, rewarding a clear tribal shift towards the BJP by the community, one option before the leadership is 59-year-old Vishnu Dev Sai, former union minister of state and Chhattisgarh BJP president. Sai was president for four years between 2018 and 2022, and has won the elections from Kunkuri in north Chhattisgarh, a region the BJP has swept.
Saroj Pandey contested and won the Chhattisgarh Assembly elections from Vaishali Nagar as a BJP candidate first in 2008. Before that, she had served as the Mayor of Durg in Chhattisgarh. In 2009, the BJP nominated her for a seat in the Lok Sabha, which she also won. In 2018, she was elected to the Rajya Sabha.

Notably, she is one of the central observers appointed by the BJP for the election of its legislature party leaders in Rajasthan.

INDIA NEWS,COP28: Draft lists adaptation targets for countries to be achieved by 2030,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop28-draft-lists-adaptation-targets-for-countries-to-be-achieved-by-2030-101702197576514.html,"A first draft text on the ‘Global Goal on Adaptation’, which is expected to be negotiated at COP28, was released on Sunday morning. The draft has the long-term adaptation efforts that countries are supposed to make towards reducing the vulnerability of countries and communities to extreme climate impacts. However, the text is extremely weak on climate finance provisions that will help developing countries meet these adaptation targets, experts say.
The Global Goal on Adaptation is an important issue for India as it is highly vulnerable to climate impacts. India submitted its third national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Saturday. In India, public finance covers most of the adaptation-based activities through flagship programmes, schemes etc.
Around 40 ministries have adaptation-relevant budgetary provisions. The total adaptation-relevant expenditure was 5.6% of the GDP in 2021-2022, growing from a share of 3.7% in 2015-16, the communication said. India also informed in its national communication that the large gap in fulfilling adaptation needs cannot be met only through government resources.

The text lists at least seven adaptation targets that countries need to take by 2030. These include attaining climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply; strengthening resilience against climate-related health impacts, promoting climate-resilient health services, and reducing climate-related morbidity; increasing the resilience of infrastructure and human settlements to climate change impacts to ensuring basic and continuous essential services for all and substantially reducing poverty and livelihood vulnerability in areas with high climate risk.
This strand of work on adaptation is one of the main deliverables at COP28, but until now, there has been no progress on it as the countries have not yet agreed on the framework and the finance provisions to implement these measures in developing countries.
“The framework for the global goal on adaptation should guide long-term transformational and incremental adaptation efforts towards reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience, as well as the collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the preservation and regeneration of nature, for current and future generations, taking into account the best available science and the worldviews and values of Indigenous Peoples, to support the achievement of the global goal on adaptation,” the draft text states.
The text states the framework will be implemented in line with equity and national circumstances. “Affirms that efforts about the targets referred to in paragraphs 10–11 (adaptation measures) shall be made in a manner that is country-driven, voluntary and in accordance with national circumstances and that they shall not constitute a basis for comparison between Parties”.

The draft calls on countries to accelerate swift action at ‘scale and at all levels’– from local to global on seven targets by 2030. These include: Significantly reducing climate-induced water scarcity and enhancing climate resilience to water-related hazards towards a climate-resilient water supply, climate-resilient sanitation and universal access to safe and affordable potable water; Attaining climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increasing sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition; Strengthening resilience against climate-related health impacts, promoting climate-resilient health services, and reducing climate-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in the most vulnerable communities; Reducing climate impacts on ecosystems and accelerating the use of ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions; Increasing the resilience of infrastructure and human settlements to climate change impacts to ensure basic and continuous essential services for all, halving climate-related impacts on infrastructure and human settlements by 2030 and eliminating all such impacts by 2040; Substantially reducing poverty and livelihood vulnerability in areas with high climate risk and ensuring that communities in such areas are covered by at least one adaptive social protection measure; And protecting cultural heritage from the impacts of climate-related risks by developing adaptive strategies.
The text also lays out a process for reviewing the strategy for the implementation of these goals. By 2025, all the countries have to put in place up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and vulnerabilities and have used these assessments to inform their formulation of national adaptation plans and nationally determined contributions, and by 2027, all have to establish multi-hazard early warning systems and climate information services for risk reduction.

The text further notes with concern that the adaptation finance gap is widening and reiterates the call urging developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025.
The text on equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) is not yet agreed upon, with a ‘no text’ option inserted by developed countries. Overall targets are weak, lacking metrics to measure progress on adaptation related to water scarcity, water-related hazards, health, food, agriculture, and ecosystems. The text proposes a two-year work program to develop these metrics and review the framework, potentially delaying progress, said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International.

INDIA NEWS,"I-T raids on liquor breweries enter day 5; ₹300 cr recovered so far, say officials",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itraids-on-liquor-breweries-enter-day-5-300-cr-recovered-so-far-say-officials-101702193917511.html,"Fresh IT raids on country liquor breweries in Odisha’s Bolangir district resumed on Sunday morning as bank officials doubled down their efforts in counting the currency notes in the distillery and country liquor breweries linked to Congress MP Dheeraj Sahu from Jharkhand.
On Sunday morning, IT raids at the country liquor breweries of Buntu Sahu and Rajesh Sahu, close to the family members of Baldeo Sahu & Group of Companies, the partnership firm of Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd (BDPL), which owns and operates distillery plants in Odisha apart from several microbreweries resumed with reports of more cash being recovered.
On Saturday, wads of currency notes were found in Sudapada brewery in Bolangir district from an iron chest. The Income Tax department had said that it had counted cash worth Rs.300 crore and expected the seized money to be around Rs.350 crore, with more counting machines pressed to count the seized currency notes.
On Friday night, dozens of bags filled with currency were seized from the Balangir house of liquor trader Bunty, an associate of Ritesh, who is the MD of Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd.
A 12-member team was divided into separate groups, who took part in the simultaneous raids. About four Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans also were deployed to assist the raid teams at BDPL.

Following the seizure, the I-T department brought the cash bags and sacks loaded in a large truck to the State Bank of India’s Bolangir branch.
The IT officials also brought in Bunty and Rajesh to the State Bank of India (SBI) Bolangir where the cash was being counted by over 50 officials using at least four dozen counting machines.
In the SBI branches of Titlagarh and Sambalour, the officials have so far counted currencies of nearly Rs.50 crore while in SBI Bolangir main branch, Rs.140 crore of cash have been counted from around 100 bags.
Bhagat Behera, regional manager of SBI, Bolangir, said, the cash counting may go on till Monday. “Though we have enough machines, they are heating up due to continuous counting. As bankers, we have never used machines for hours like this. Many currency notes are sticking to each other due to mildew deposits and so we are using dryers to separate the notes that have clung together,” he said.
Meanwhile, I-T officials said during the raids on one of the country liquor breweries in Bolangir’s Sudapada area, they found a polythene packet containing Rs.5 lakh in currency notes and the name ‘Inspector Tiwari’ mentioned on the packet. “We think the person may either be from the excise department or local police. We would interrogate officials from the excise department,” the official said refusing to be named.
A special 20-member I-T analysis team from Hyderabad joined the investigation to scan through the computer hard disk and other electronic items recovered during the raid.
Even as the raids were continuing, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Saturday conducted press conferences in different parts of the country alleging that the money seized was indicative of the Congress’s corruption.
In Jharkhand, from where Dheeraj Sahu is Rajya Sabha MP, BJP leader Babulal Mirandi has alleged that the money belonged to chief minister Hemant Soren.
I-T personnel first raided Boudh Distilleries Private Limited in Boudh district of Odisha on December 6 morning over reports of tax evasion and later searched the premises of Baldeo Sahu and Group of Companies in other places of Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal.
Headquartered in Odisha, the Boudh Distillery Private Limited comprises 4 companies - Boudh Distillery Private Limited, Baldeo Sahu Infra Private Limited which makes Fly Ash bricks, Kwality Bottlers Private Limited (IMFL Bottling) and Kishore Prasad Bijay Prasad Beverages Private Limited (Sales & Marketing of IMFL brands).

The I-T department officials said they had suspicions over the company’s inconsistent and low net profits between 2019 and 2021 inflated expenses towards the purchase of mahua/other articles and suspicious other payable shown in the balance sheet.
Of the Rs.300 crore seized, Rs.250 crore was confiscated from several almirahs at the BDPL’s premises in Bolangir district, while the remainder was seized from locations in Titlagarh, Sambalpur, and Ranchi. However, no one has been arrested so far.
The raids have been initiated following “actionable intelligence” regarding significant “out of book” sales and cash remittances by liquor distributors, sellers, and business groups, the agency had said earlier.
The IT officials confirmed that the cash seizure in Odisha, Jharkhand and Bengal is the highest-ever made by any agency in the country against a single group and its connected entities.

It has been observed every year since 2003 to create awareness about the importance of mountains in our lives, highlight the opportunities and constraints in mountain development, and build alliances that will bring positive change globally to people and the environment in the mountains. Mountains are our natural jewels. Moreover, they are home to 15% of the world's population, host about half the biodiversity hotspots of the world, and provide fresh water for everyday life to half of humanity to sustain agriculture and supply clean energy and medicines. Scroll through to learn more about International Mountain Day, its correct date, the theme for this year, and why we should safeguard mountains for a better future.
International Mountain Day falls on December 11. This year, it is on Monday. The theme for 2023 is Restoring Mountain Ecosystems. It aims to increase awareness about the relevance of mountain ecosystems.
According to the United Nations official website, the United Nations headquarters in New York launched the International Year of Mountains on December 11, 2001. Later, in 2002, the International Year of Mountains was marked with the aim of raising awareness and triggering action on issues relating to sustainable mountain development. On December 20, 2002, the UN designated December 11 as International Mountain Day. They urged the international community to take proper steps to ensure sustainable mountain development. The first International Mountain Day was then observed on December 11, 2003. Each year, a theme has been assigned to this day which focuses on various issues, including freshwater, peace, biodiversity or climate change.
Mountains cover around 27 per cent of the Earth's land surface and host about half of the world's biodiversity hotspots. They also provide freshwater to an estimated half of humanity. They are also home to an extraordinary range of plants and animals and many culturally diverse communities with different languages and traditions. Yet, mountains suffer from the climate change impacts. Therefore, it is important to observe International Mountain Day to remind international communities to take measures to safeguard their biodiversity.

While you may have long-term goals in mind regarding your relationship, your partner may just be enjoying the present moment, and not planning a future with you. One-sided expectations can lead to heartbreak and to avoid such a situation, one should pay close attention to signs if their partner is truly serious about them or not. People who have long-term relationship in mind like to involve their partners in decision-making and their likes and dislikes matter to them a lot. If your partner is seeking your opinion about important decisions of their life, it certainly indicates seriousness on their part. Another sign could be their genuine desire to know things and motivations of your life and not just plain talk. (Also read | Signs that you may have outgrown relationships or situations around you)
""The danger of getting attention from someone we like is that we can quickly start to invest in a story that our mind has created and ignore whether we see signs they are really investing in us. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the attention someone is giving you. Just don’t confuse attention with genuine intention. You can’t instantly know what someone’s intentions are, of course, but there are things you can look out for along the way that may give you some clues,"" says Matthew Hussey, Relationship expert and NYT bestselling author of Get The Guy fame.
Here are 4 signs that your partner is serious about you, explained by Hussey.
Ask yourself - are they thinking about you in their decision-making process or do you only hear about decisions once they have been made?
Are they genuinely trying to get to know you or just enjoying your company? Someone with real intention will ask questions because they are evaluating you for a more important role in their life.
People who want to take things ahead with you, will keep future in mind while talking to you. Are they getting excited about things they want to do/see/experience with you beyond tomorrow night?
Do their actions show they are actually prepared to invest in their dynamic with you? Words alone can be cheap; their actions should reflect what they are saying to you.

LIFESTYLE,Personalising decor: Creative ideas to add unique touches to your home interiors,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/personalising-decor-creative-ideas-to-add-unique-touches-to-your-home-interiors-101702210415491.html,"Personalisation of home interiors serves as a tangible reflection of one's individuality, seamlessly merging style with practicality. By infusing unique touches into interiors, we can elevate the aesthetic appeal while catering to specific needs.
From bespoke decor elements to custom-built furniture, there is a diverse array of options to personalise home interiors. Further, incorporating meaningful artwork, curated colour palettes, and strategic lighting schemes can transform a space into a true reflection of its inhabitants.
Artwork serves as an authentic expression of one’s personality and can significantly influence the ambience of a space. Consider decorating the interiors with pieces that resonate with you, be it paintings, sculptures, or mixed-media installations.
In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Ar Gaurav Pathak, Founder at Design21, shared, “Large-scale canvases can be a focal point in a room, while smaller sculptures and art pieces can be strategically placed to draw attention to specific areas. The juxtaposition of colours, textures, and forms adds an air of sophistication and individuality to the interiors.”
Furniture is more than just functional; it's an opportunity for self-expression. Ar Abhigyan Neogi, Founder and Principal Architect of Chromed Design Studio, suggested, “Opt for custom-made furniture pieces that reflect your tastes and preferences. From bespoke sofas to handcrafted dining tables, the options are limitless. Choose materials, finishes, and designs that resonate with your aesthetic. A well-designed and customised furniture not only serves its purpose but also becomes a conversation starter, adding depth and character to your living spaces.”
Textures play a crucial role in interior design, adding depth and richness to a space and these textures can be incorporated in various ways, such as textiles, wall coverings, and accessories. Ar Bhuvan Kapila, Founder and Principal Architect at Workshop for Metropolitan Architecture (WMA), explained, “Consider plush rugs, tactile cushions, and statement upholstery. Mix and match materials like silk, leather, wool, and natural fibres to create a harmonious yet visually intriguing environment. Further, textured wall coverings, such as stone veneers or embossed wallpapers, can create focal points that add a touch of luxury and uniqueness to your interiors.”
Curated decor is a powerful way to infuse personal experiences into your living spaces. Vipul Soni, Founder and Principal Designer at Soni Vipul Designs, revealed, “Whether it's antique pieces, repurposed vintage decor or unique travel souvenirs, arranging them thoughtfully can create a narrative that reflects your journey. Displaying these items in curated vignettes or dedicated shelving units adds visual interest and sparks conversations.” These personal touches provide a glimpse into your interests, passions, and memories, making your space truly yours.
The significance of personalisation transcends mere aesthetics, embodying the very essence of an individual's unique identity. Through careful curation and thoughtful integration, such spaces become a testament to the harmonious blend of personal expression and functional design, creating environments that resonate deeply with their inhabitants.

Here's what a study says,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/pet/can-owning-a-cat-increase-risk-of-schizophrenia-heres-what-a-study-says-101702209854503.html,"Owning a cat can double the risk of schizophrenia-related disorders, said review of 17 studies conducted over 44 years and involving 11 countries, published in the Schizophrenia journal. Australian researchers involved in the review. The link between cat ownership and the mental disorder dates back to a 1995 study attributing the risk to exposure to the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, transmitted through undercooked meat or cat faeces. While some subsequent studies supported this association, others did not and hence a conclusive link between owning a cat and schizophrenia could not be established. (Also read | Thinking about getting a cat? Here are some essential pros and cons to help you decide)
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that can cause delusions, hallucinations, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation. There is no cure for schizophrenia. Toxoplasma gondii can be transmitted to human with the bite of an infected cat or its faeces.
T. gondii can get into the central nervous system and influence neurotransmitters causing personality changes, onset of psychotic symptoms, and neurological disorders like schizophrenia.
The researchers said that the 17 studies, mostly case-control studies, cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship, and the quality of some studies was deemed low. While findings varied, higher-quality studies indicated that unadjusted models might be influenced by factors affecting the results.
Studies also found that being around cats during childhood might can make a person more likely to develop schizophrenia symptoms. However, this was not supported by all studies.
The new analysis of 17 studies found that there was a significant positive association between cat ownership and an increased risk of schizophrenia-related disorders.
""After adjusting for covariates, we found that individuals exposed to cats had approximately twice the odds of developing schizophrenia,"" as per the team of researchers.
The researchers concluded that additional high-quality, large-scale studies are necessary to better comprehend the potential role of cat ownership as a risk factor for mental disorders.

Life is full of challenges, yet taking on one is exhilarating and fulfilling. It fills you with a sense of accomplishment and gives you stories for lifetime to share with your friends, children, and grandchildren.

Working on your fitness levels doesn't have to be repetitive and boring. With mountaineering, achieving your ideal weight couldn't be more fun. The process of preparing your body for climbing mountains in itself can make it more flexible, agile and fit. (See pics: International Mountain Day 2023: Most beautiful mountains in the world)
""In a world filled with bustling cities and fast-paced lifestyles, the celebration of International Mountain Day serves as a reminder to reconnect with nature. Beyond their awe-inspiring beauty, mountains offer a myriad of health benefits, especially through activities like hiking and mountain climbing. As we celebrate the majesty of these towering landscapes, let's delve into the incredible ways these activities contribute to our overall well-being,"" says Dr. Vikramjeet Singh, Senior Consultant-Internal Medicine, Aakash Healthcare, New Delhi.
Dr Singh in an interview with HT Digital shares wonderful health benefits of hiking and mountain climbing.
Hiking and mountain climbing are excellent cardiovascular workouts. The uneven terrain, steep inclines, and rocky paths engage various muscle groups, enhancing overall fitness. These activities promote heart health by improving blood circulation, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and enhancing the efficiency of the respiratory system.
The serene landscapes and fresh mountain air create a therapeutic environment that aids stress reduction. The physical exertion releases endorphins, the body's natural mood lifters, promoting a sense of well-being. Additionally, the meditative aspects of being surrounded by nature contribute to reduced anxiety and improved mental clarity.
Navigating through rocky trails and uneven terrains requires constant adjustments and balance. Engaging in hiking and climbing helps enhance proprioception, improving overall balance and coordination. This not only contributes to better physical performance but also reduces the risk of falls in daily life.
Spending time outdoors exposes the body to natural sunlight, a rich source of vitamin D. This essential vitamin is crucial for bone health, immune system function, and mental well-being. Hiking and climbing provide an opportunity to soak in the sun's rays, ensuring an adequate supply of vitamin D.
Physical activity in the mountains leads to a more restful sleep. The combination of fresh air, increased physical exertion, and the calming effects of nature contribute to better sleep quality. Adequate rest is essential for overall health, aiding in recovery and rejuvenation.
Reaching the summit of a mountain or completing a challenging trail instils a profound sense of achievement and self-empowerment. Overcoming obstacles and pushing personal boundaries during these activities can boost confidence and resilience, positively impacting mental health.
Hiking and climbing often involve group activities, fostering social connections and community bonding. Shared experiences in the great outdoors create lasting memories and strengthen interpersonal relationships, contributing to a sense of belonging and emotional well-being.
""These activities not only provide a physical challenge but also offer a holistic approach to health, encompassing mental, emotional, and social aspects. So, lace up your hiking boots, embrace the summit, and embark on a journey towards a healthier and happier life.

LIFESTYLE,Visiting Italy? Check out this 'prison bakery' in ancient Roman city of Pompeii,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/travel/visiting-italy-check-out-this-prison-bakery-in-ancient-roman-city-of-pompeii-101702196960154.html,"Archaeologists excavating the ancient Roman city of Pompeii have uncovered a ""prison bakery"" where slaves and blindfolded donkeys were kept locked up underground to grind grain for bread, officials said this week.
Underneath a house in the ruins they found ""a cramped room with no view of the outside world and with small windows high in the wall, with iron bars, to let the light in"", the Archaeological Park of Pompeii announced on Friday.
Archaeologists deduced they had found a ""prison bakery"", the UNESCO World Heritage Site near Naples, southern Italy, said on its website.
They also discovered ""indentations"" in the floor ""to coordinate the movement of the animals, forced to walk around for hours, blindfolded"".
The house, on the 44-hectare site that is currently under excavation, was divided into a residential area ""decorated with exquisite Fourth Style frescoes"" and a ""productive quarter"", the bakery.
Three skeletons were discovered in one room of the bakery, showing that the house was inhabited.
The bakery, where slaves and animals were forced to perform the backbreaking task of turning the millstones, had no doors or communication with the outside world.
""It is, in other words, a space in which we have to imagine the presence of people of servile status whose freedom of movement the owner felt the need to restrict,"" wrote Pompeii director Gabriel Zuchtreigel in a scholarly article.
""It is the most shocking side of ancient slavery, the one devoid of both trusting relationships and promises of manumission, where we were reduced to brute violence, an impression that is entirely confirmed by the securing of the few windows with iron bars.""
The public can view more evidence of this harsh daily life in an exhibition called ""The Other Pompeii: Ordinary Lives in the Shadow of Vesuvius"" which opens at the Palestra Grande in Pompeii on December 15.
""(The exhibition is) dedicated to that myriad of individuals often forgotten by the historical sources, such as the slaves, who constituted the majority of the population and whose labour contributed in an important way not only to the economy, but also to the culture and social fabric of Roman civilization,"" the Pompeii authorities said.
Pompeii was devastated when nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted almost 2,000 years ago in 79 AD.
The ash and rock helped preserve many buildings almost in their original state, as well as forming eery shapes around the curled-up corpses of victims of the disaster, thought to number around 3,000.
Pompeii is the second most visited tourist destination in Italy after the Colosseum in Rome.

To realise this vision, Yokohama City organised the Y-Ship global event. It aimed to establish an innovative and smart city with collaborations with start-ups from across the world and companies from Asia-Africa's emerging countries.
Mayor Taake Haru Yamanaka explained the history of Yokohama and appealed for the cooperation of participating countries to realise the Smart city vision.
Toru Hashimoto, the organizer of Y-Ship, said that Yokohama has been a city that created new technologies to be introduced into Japan since the opening of the port some 160 years ago.
""There are major urban problems and climate change around the world, and various new innovations are necessary. Together with our colleagues from all over the world and people; developed countries and developing countries, we will create new innovations in Yokohama. This is an international conference aimed at this purpose,"" he said.
He added that many international collaborations are expected through this event and the Japanese incinerator company has established a Branch in the Philippines to develop its business further.
Hashimoto further said that it is very important to have a city that is ""liveable, safe and secure"".
""I think it is necessary to make Yokohama a low-carbon, eco-friendly city that can embrace everyone. After establishing it, Yokohama will be respected all over the world, and I think there will be more friends who would like to try to build a town like Yokohama together with us,"" stated.
Joji Kitamura from Amcon said, ""Since we are doing business both domestically and internationally, I think we can look forward to our business in Asia"".
A participant from the Philippines admired Y-Ship's achievement and said that this is something he would like to see in his city.
""It's very different from our city. It's very nice. Everything is very nice. You can walk around and it's very pretty. The park is very nice and it's very modern. It's something that you would also like to see in our city. We have already established ties and we want to build it much stronger,"" the participant said.
The Yokohama city has already confirmed its charm and is now prepping to grow up as a more sustainable, innovative and liveable city.

LIFESTYLE,Indonesia's Prambanan temple: Testimony to India's ties with South East Asia,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/indonesia-prambanan-temple-a-testimony-to-indias-deep-rooted-cultural-ties-with-south-east-asia-101702191953173.html,"Centuries-old Prambanan temple, a large compound consisting of 240 Hindu temples on the outskirts of Yogyakarta city in Muslim-majority Indonesia, stands as a testimony to India's deep-rooted cultural and historical ties with South East Asia.
The 10th-century Prambanan temple, located approximately 17 kilometres northeast of Yogyakarta city, is considered Indonesia's largest Hindu temple.
A UNESCO heritage site, the Prambanan temple popularly known as Candi Prambanan is among many such temples in Indonesia which are aiming to attract tourists from India beyond Bali.
India has been generous with its funds in the restoration of some of the temples in the region and has extended services under cultural diplomacy to nations that are geographically as well as culturally close.
In ASEAN nations, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has restored historical sites in Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia.
In Jakarta, India's Ambassador to ASEAN Jayant Khobragade said that New Delhi is not involved in the restoration work at the Prambanan temple. However, India has been assisting in the renovation of a few temples in some of the ASEAN states, he added.
The original Prambanan temple compound, destroyed by major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions over centuries, was rediscovered in the 17th century and is now being restored.
""The temple was built on the method of interlocking stones. It's a very complex structure. So far, only 22 temples out of 240 temples in the compound have been restored,"" a local official said, adding that work on restoring more structures is in progress.
The temple is dedicated to three main Hindu deities ‘Trimurti’ - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
""Restoration works have been conducted since 1918, both in the original traditional method of interlocking stone and modern methods using concrete to strengthen the temple structure,"" according to the UNESCO website.
A government-authorised tourist guide at the temple complex while explaining the unique construction style of the structure said that the restoration work was difficult because there were no pictures available of the original compound.
""It's a UNESCO heritage site. The rules don’t allow more than 25 per cent of new stones to be used for restoration. That's also one of the reasons why restoration work is taking time,"" he added.
The original plan of the Prambanan temple was rectangular, consisting of an outer courtyard, middle courtyard and inner courtyard. The temples are sub-divided into a higher and a lower terrace.
On the higher terrace are three major temples dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma with three smaller temples of their animal vehicles in front of them. The temple facing the Vishnu temple is the Garuda temple, the one facing the Shiva temple is the Nandi temple, and the one facing the Brahma temple is the Angsa temple.
The Shiva temple is the largest and the most prominent. The temple is 34 by 34 metres in width, and 47 metres in height and has four chambers which contain a statue inside each one.
In the eastern chamber, there is a Shiva statue, whereas the western chamber contains the Ganesha statue. A statue of Durga is in the northern chamber, while the southern chamber has the statue of Agastya.
The inner side of the walls of the Shiva temple is decorated with reliefs illustrating the epic Ramayana. Along its walls, 56 scenes about Lord Rama's stories are portrayed.
The Brahma temple is located at the south of Shiva temple. Its shapes and constructs are similar to the Shiva temple, though in a smaller dimension. On its walls, the Ramayana stories were sculpted, which continued the story that began at the Shiva temple. One of the scenes of the reliefs portrayed a battle between Lord Rama and demon king Ravana.
On the other side of the Shiva temple is the Vishnu temple, whose shapes and constructs are similar to the Shiva temple and whose dimension is the same as that of the Brahma temple.
On the lower terrace are four sets of smaller temples surrounded by an inner wall with four gates. Almost all the temples in the central courtyard are currently in ruins.
Two priests, appointed by the authorities, perform prayers thrice every day in front of the Shiva temple.
""We perform puja thrice a day. In the morning around 8, we perform ‘Surya Puja’, around noon ‘Raina Puja’ is done and the final one is performed around sunset. The prayers are offered to Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,"" a priest told PTI after performing the evening prayers.
He said that Indonesia and India are culturally connected and Hinduism spread to Java from India.
""The temple is a testimony to India's deep-rooted cultural ties with South East Asia,"" he added.
The local administration regularly organises events around the temple complex to encourage people to visit the historical site.
In November end, around 400 yoga enthusiasts participated in a yoga event in the temple park.
The event was the highlight of the Jogja Cultural Wellness Festival, which presents the concept of wellness tourism by paying attention to holistic health and personal happiness.
Not far from the Prambanan temple lies the Kedu Valley, where one of the largest Buddhist monuments in the world - the Borobudur Temple - is located.
The 8th-century temple, also a UNESCO heritage site, was built in three tiers: a pyramidal base with five concentric square terraces, the trunk of a cone with three circular platforms and, at the top, a monumental stupa.
“There is a large influx of tourists, mostly domestic, at these places. However, not many people from India visit them. Bali is popular among Indian tourists but Yogyakarta remains unexplored,” said a local guide.
In the future, India would contribute to a significant boost in the number of visitors to these places, he hoped.

LIFESTYLE,US approves CRISPR gene-editing to treat sickle cell disease,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/us-approves-crispr-gene-editing-to-treat-sickle-cell-disease-101702191469722.html,"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Friday approved a landmark gene-editing treatment for sickle cell disease. The US drug regulator ""approved two milestone treatments, Casgevy and Lyfgenia, representing the first cell-based gene therapies for the treatment of sickle cell disease,"" it said in a statement.
As DW reported last month, Exa-cel, using the brand name Casgevz, is based on CRISPR, a Nobel Prize-winning gene editing tool, used to snip patients' DNA.
Casgevy was also approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency last month.
""Sickle cell disease is a rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disorder with significant unmet need,"" the FDA's Dr. Nicole Verdun said in a statement announcing the approvals.
""We are excited to advance the field especially for individuals whose lives have been severely disrupted by the disease.""
In the US, an estimated 100,000 people have the disease, and globally, it affects more than 7.7 million people, primarily people of African or Caribbean descent.
Sickle cell patients have elongated blood cells resembling sickles rather than normal blood cells' typical donut shape. These misshaped cells can get stuck in the blood vessels and block the oxygen supply, causing patients to experience excruciating pain, strokes, and organ damage.
The new medication, Casgevy, targets the problematic gene in a patient's bone marrow stem cells. It results in the production of properly functioning hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, in the body.
Patients first receive a course of chemotherapy before doctors take stem cells from the patient's bone marrow, and then those cells are treated with the medication in a lab, which, using the CRISPR gene editing tool, essentially cuts out the sections of DNA that cause the sickle shape.
The treated stem cells are reintroduced into the body.
Gene therapy treatments can cost millions of dollars and experts have raised concerns that they could remain out of reach for the people who would benefit most.
The other treatment approved by the FDA, Lyfgenia, utilizes a harmless virus to insert a gene into patients' stem cells.
Before Casgevy and Lyfgenia were approved treatments included medications and blood transfusions.
The only permanent solution was a bone marrow transplant, which must come from a closely matched donor without the disease and brings a risk of rejection.

LIFESTYLE,Sleep deprivation and vertigo: Here's how lack of sleep can impact balance,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/sleep-deprivation-and-vertigo-heres-how-lack-of-sleep-can-impact-balance-101702187314978.html,"According to reports, vertigo is quite common, with 1 in 10 people across the world experiencing it in their lifetime and in terms of symptoms, vertigo is a disorienting sensation of spinning or dizziness. It can be caused by various factors, including inner ear problems, infections or even stress.
In an interview with HT Lifestyle, ENT surgeon Dr Vikas Agrawal, revealed, “When sleep is disrupted or inadequate, the body’s ability to repair and regenerate itself may be compromised. This may lead to vertigo. How are sleep and vertigo connected? Let us direct our attention to the vestibular system (an apparatus of the inner ear) which is responsible for balance and spatial orientation and understand the connection.”
He elaborated -
1. Vestibular System and Sleep: The vestibular system is a complex network of structures within the inner ear that plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and equilibrium. It includes semicircular canals filled with fluid and tiny hair cells that detect movement. Proper functioning of the vestibular system is essential for our ability to stand, walk and maintain stable posture. Sleep is vital for the maintenance and repair of these delicate structures. In a recent study titled ""Sleep Disturbances and Vertigo: A Bidirectional Relationship,"" which was published in the Journal of Vestibular Research, it was found that patients with co-morbid cardiometabolic diseases who have poor sleep have worse vertigo outcomes. It further suggests a bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and vertigo.
2. Sleep and Vestibular System Maintenance: During deep sleep stages, the body undergoes essential repair and regeneration processes. This includes the maintenance of the vestibular system. The fluid in the semicircular canals needs to remain at the right consistency, and the hair cells must be in good condition to detect movement accurately. Inadequate sleep can disrupt these processes, potentially leading to vestibular system dysfunction and an increased risk of vertigo.
3. Sleep-Related Disorders: Certain sleep-related disorders can directly contribute to vertigo. For example, sleep apnea, a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, can lead to reduced oxygen levels and changes in blood flow to the inner ear, which may trigger vertigo or worsen existing vertigo symptoms.
4. Stress and Sleep: Stress is a common trigger for vertigo, and it can also disrupt sleep patterns. Chronic stress can lead to increased muscle tension and anxiety, which may contribute to vestibular issues and vertigo. Quality sleep helps regulate stress hormones and reduces the overall stress burden on the body.
5. Medications: Some medications prescribed for vertigo or related conditions may affect sleep patterns as a side effect. For example, certain drugs used to manage vertigo symptoms may cause drowsiness or insomnia, which can impact sleep quality.
Dr Vikas Agrawal concluded, “Good sleep supports the maintenance of a healthy vestibular system, reduces stress, and enhances overall well-being. By prioritizing sleep and adopting healthy sleep habits, individuals can take proactive steps to minimize the risk of experiencing vertigo.”

LIFESTYLE,3 fitness and wellness tips for women to keep glowing amidst a bustling career,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/3-fitness-and-wellness-tips-for-women-to-keep-glowing-amidst-the-whirlwind-of-a-bustling-career-101702181767214.html,"Maintaining a balance between a busy schedule and a healthy lifestyle is a significant challenge in today's fast-paced and demanding world where with numerous responsibilities and commitments pulling women in different directions, finding the time and energy to prioritise their well-being can seem like an uphill battle. However, it is essential for both our physical and mental well-being to strike this balance, as neglecting our health can lead to burnout, reduced productivity and long-term health issues.
In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Kannada actor Pranitha Subhash shared some simple yet effective tips that have kept her glowing amidst the whirlwind of a bustling career and can keep your health and wellness in check too -
Amidst the hustle and bustle of the entertainment industry, taking care of one's mental well-being is often overlooked. However, I have learned the hard way that mental health is crucial for overall well-being and productivity. I believe in prioritising 'Me Time' to unwind and recharge. One unique technique I use is ""Nature Reconnection."" Whenever possible, I retreat to nature, whether it is a weekend getaway or a quick walk-in a nearby park. Nature has a magical way of grounding and rejuvenating the mind, providing much-needed solace in times of stress Being surrounded by the beauty of nature allows me to take a step back from the chaos and find solace in the simplicity of the natural world. It gives me a chance to reflect, introspect, and gain perspective on my life and priorities. This time spent in nature becomes a valuable opportunity to reset my mind and come back to my work and responsibilities with a clearer and calmer mindset. I also love incorporating meditation into my daily routine as a powerful tool for mental clarity and inner peace.
When your schedule is filled with auditions, rehearsals, shoots and other professional commitments that demand time and energy, it is no surprise that the convenience of fast food or ready-to-eat meals can be tempting as you are on the go. However, prioritising nutritious convenience is vital for sustaining your physical and mental well-being in the long run. Planning and preparing meals in advance may seem challenging with a busy schedule, but it can make a significant difference in your overall health. Consider setting aside some time during the week for meal prepping. You can prepare large batches of healthy recipes and store them in individual containers, making it easy to grab a nutritious meal when you are in a hurry. Opt for nutrient-dense foods that provide your body with the essential vitamins, minerals and macronutrients it needs and when it comes to a nutrient powerhouse, almonds are hard to beat. Incorporating almonds into your daily diet can significantly enhance the nutritional value of your meals and snacks. These versatile nuts make for a perfect, convenient snack option, and I personally find it beneficial to keep some almonds handy in my bag for whenever hunger strikes. Pairing them with fruits or incorporating them into other snacks adds an extra dose of health and flavour to my daily routine.
Whether you have a hectic workday or a packed social calendar, these small bursts of exercise can make a significant difference in maintaining your physical well-being. One of the simplest ways to integrate mini workouts is by taking short walks. During breaks at work or in between tasks, take a stroll around the office or the surrounding area. Not only does this get your body moving but it also provides a mental break and a chance to refresh your mind. If you find yourself waiting for appointments or meetings, make the most of that time by doing quick bodyweight exercises. You can perform exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, or even desk dips. These exercises do not require any equipment and can be done almost anywhere. Even a few minutes of these bodyweight exercises can improve your strength and boost your energy levels.
Taking care of yourself not only benefits your career but also enriches your personal life, leading to a more fulfilled and content existence. Remember, your well-being is your most valuable asset, so make it a priority as you embark on your journey to success.

LIFESTYLE,Code name - Blockbuster: Poonam Saxena on Bollywood’s infatuation with the spy,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/code-name-blockbuster-poonam-saxena-on-bollywood-s-infatuation-with-the-spy-101702140749975.html,"Since spy films have been the ticket to box-office triumph this year (I’m looking at you, Pathaan and Tiger 3), I couldn’t help but go back to a spy thriller from a different era. Released 55 years ago, it was a pioneer of the genre, the biggest hit of 1968, and made by the last man you would associate with guns and bombs.

The man in question was born Chandramouli Chopra in 1917 (though he would later change his name). He wrote Raj Kapoor’s great 1949 romance, Barsaat. He went on to launch his own banner, Sagar Films, with a love story (Arzoo, 1965). And two decades later, made a TV serial that irrevocably changed his life: Ramayan.
The man was Ramanand Sagar. And somewhere between Arzoo and Ramayan, he also directed a suspenseful spy film, Ankhen, starring Dharmendra and Mala Sinha. It would be the most successful film of his career. A fun, 174-minute ride, it is set in India, Japan and Lebanon, and features two dedicated agents, Sunil (Dharmendra) and Meenakshi (Sinha), fearlessly fighting enemies of the nation.
They aren’t working for the Indian government, though; they’re part of a secret group founded by three patriots and stalwarts of the Azad Hind Fauj: Diwan Chand, Ashfaq Bhai and Ishak Singh, a Hindu, a Muslim and a Sikh. (It’s easy to spot the symbolism. In real life, Colonel Prem Sahgal, Major General Shah Nawaz Khan and Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon of the Indian National Army or INA were court-martialled by the British, in a trial that shook the country in 1945-46.)

LIFESTYLE,"A miracle of right place, right time: Rudraneil Sengupta on Jude Bellingham",https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/a-miracle-of-right-place-right-time-rudraneil-sengupta-on-jude-bellingham-101702140208053.html,"How do you become the leading, most influential, most charismatic player on a team like Real Madrid; before you’ve turned 20; having played just a handful of games in your debut season for the club? Ask Jude Bellingham.

He’s had 15 goals and four assists in his first 16 matches for Real Madrid, and is the only player in the club’s history to have scored in his first four matches on the trot. Those are just the numbers. Consider the influence: the way he commands the Madrid midfield, links play, picks out just the right pass for just the right person; finds those shadow positions where he can put the slip on his marker, extend a toe, and score.
Bellingham won the Golden Boy Award this month, conferred by journalists in Europe to the most promising young player under 21 on the continent.
Bellingham turned 20 in June, and he’s certainly earned it. Before the start of the season, Madrid were a team in transition. Their most influential midfielders were either moving (Casemiro) or becoming less effective with age (Luka Modric). Their most prolific assist-maker and second-highest goal-scorer, Karim Benzema, had left for the Saudi Pro League. What Madrid were looking for was a miracle-maker in their attacking play; what they found was the second coming of Zinedine Zidane.
On a more serious note, perhaps the most startling thing about Bellingham is just how much his style of play resembles Zidane’s: those magic touches, the quick turn and acceleration into the box, the little flicks that turn into glorious defence-splitting passes.
The young Englishman from Birmingham started out a prodigy. He was selected for Birmingham City’s academy at seven, made his senior debut in an English second-tier game at 16 (the youngest ever for Birmingham). The following year, he had been scouted and drafted by the best youth development club around today, Bundesliga’s Borussia Dortmund.
He had a brilliant debut season, and became one of only two players in Champions League history to have played more than 10 games in the league before turning 18 (the other is Kylian Mbappe).

Should it be a professional or a group, an online or offline one? People like oneself, or people whose loss most closely resembles one’s own?

“It’s easy to find resources for emotional support and to connect with others going through difficult times on social media. But healing following traumatic loss is an intimate, personal process, requiring deep introspection,” says Dr Lisa Shulman, professor of neurology at the University of Maryland and author of Before and After Loss: A Neurologist’s Perspective… (2018).
If grieving rituals around the world look the way they do (calendars of events; opportunities to memorialise), it’s because that is one truth that endures: As we live with the repercussions of loss, it can help to find ways, large and small, to honour our loved ones to bring us comfort, Dr Shulman says.
That is the path radio jockey Stutee Ghosh aka RJ Stutee chose, when she lost her father Ranjan Ghosh, a philosophy professor, artist and art critic, to Covid-19 in May 2021.
The programming head at Fever FM (which is owned by HT Media Ltd, which also publishes the Hindustan Times), was known for her vivacious radio personality and celebrity chat shows. After her father’s death, at age 70, she could not find her feet, could not regain equilibrium, she says.
He was gone so suddenly, in the midst of such a “cold, distant, isolated, unnatural time”. In her anguish, she turned to the microphone.
Between June and August 2021, she hosted a nine-episode podcast called Mera Wala Grief on HT Smartcast. Along with Deepti Ahuja, head of content and production at HT Smartcast, she crafted a conversational show on which celebrities ranging from filmmakers Hansal Mehta and Guneet Monga to broadcaster Barkha Dutt could talk about how they coped with the loss of a parent, partner or friend.
In a strange time, the podcast acted as “a safe space for people to be vulnerable,” Ahuja says. “There was space for silence, tears, shaky voices, dark sarcasm… various shades of grief.”
Ghosh shared details from her father’s life. In her conversation with Dutt, the two discussed the guilt that sprung from their helplessness in the face of the virus; talked about living in fear of the grief that swamped them in waves; and of their struggle to find meaning in the everyday again.
Mehta spoke of the grief that came from losing a father with whom he didn’t have a very expressive relationship. “I really thought that my father would outlive me; he was a fighter,” he said.
Writer-producer Sutapa Sikdar spoke of losing her husband, actor Irrfan Khan, to cancer in 2020. She and Ghosh discussed the ineffable things they hadn’t expected to find painful: the way Sikdar missed Urdu and watched Pakistani TV shows just to hear the language, now that Irrfan was no longer around to sprinkle it into conversation. The way Ghosh couldn’t bring herself to eat the Bengali dishes that her father had most enjoyed.
The idea was for the podcast to show that grief is not just dark, amorphous and morbid, though it can often seem so from the outside. It is essentially a way of coping, remembering, and processing love that now has nowhere to go.
People responded to that, calling in and emailing to connect with a version of RJ Stutee they had not expected to see. They shared stories of their own loss, and legacies they hoped to keep alive.
For Stutee, the sense of catharsis was immense. There was also comfort in knowing that she was not alone. “It wasn’t just me who couldn’t sleep at night, who was constantly rifling through my loved one’s belongings or suddenly feeling this tightness in my chest,” she says.
By the ninth episode, she knew it was time to stop. It was becoming difficult to carry on with the same intensity. “It took every ounce of strength in me to do the podcast, and it was a journey of discovering myself. As of right now, I don’t think I could go back to that phase,” she says.
***
American broadcaster Anderson Cooper, meanwhile, has released a second season of his grief podcast, All There Is, launched in September 2022. He lost his father at age 10, a brother when he was 21, and his mother in 2019. His podcast seeks to decode his own experiences of loss. “I realised… that I’ve never really grieved before… Experiencing loss and actually grieving are two different things,” he told CNN last month. Season 2 of All There Is was released last month.

LIFESTYLE,"What does healing look like, in unruly and unpredictable grief?",https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art-culture/what-does-healing-look-like-in-unruly-and-unpredictable-grief-101702138767041.html,"So much has changed when it comes to how we grieve.

It used to be tangible things we clung to – letters, photographs, belongings. Then came virtual memorial pages and Twitter threads.

AI chatbots can now be paid to impersonate loved ones in written and verbal conversations. Interactive memory apps such as HereAfter AI and StoryFile offer to create virtual avatars that resemble the departed person, and can be preloaded with stories from their life. These options are available, but not widespread.
So how does a population that grew up with the digital world use it in times of such loss? “The one thing that stands out about Millennials and Gen Z (roughly those aged 11 to 42 today) is that they have learned to walk with grief, using whatever means they have,” says life coach Chetna Chakravarthy.
One of those ways is to broadcast it. For many in their 40s and older, it can still feel jarring to see an announcement of death posted online by a loved one of the deceased. (Perhaps it was so when these first began to appear in newspapers).
There are, apparently, a few primary reasons the young do this.
It’s the quickest way to let their scattered tribe know of their loss, respondents aged 19 to 24 told psychologists from Birmingham City University, UK. (Their study, Exploring Young Millennials’ Motivations for Grieving Death through Social Media, was published in the Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science in 2022).
It also allows them to find a degree of catharsis and community, by allowing them access to others who have experienced similar grief. Comments invariably fill up with stories of other people’s own experiences, and this is helpful and comforting, respondents said.
A third reason cited was that it was simply less emotionally gruelling to tell people via tweet than in person. “I just find it hard to say my feeling to people and so social media was easier because I didn’t need to actually tell people face to face how I felt […] it was easier to post because you are behind a screen type thing,” as one participant put it.
A rather sinister reason emerged too: some respondents said they felt compelled to make some form of online statement, for fear that if they did not, it would be taken as a sign that they didn’t care very much about the deceased.
Interestingly, most of the respondents also said that they posted online about a death as a way to preserve a bond with the deceased person, through pictures, memories and videos — all of which mirror traditional memorial practices.

LIFESTYLE,Embrace the chill: 6 winter skincare secrets for nurtured and radiant skin,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/embrace-the-chill-6-winter-skincare-secrets-for-nurturing-your-skin-throughout-the-season-101702134030024.html,"As winter descends upon the Indian subcontinent, our skin faces unique challenges posed by the cold, dry air and sudden drops in temperature. The winter season in India demands a specialized approach to skincare that takes into account the diverse climates across the country. This is the worst time of year for skin, especially for those who suffer from dryness. Your skin becomes dry, itchy and irritated at this time of year because the cold air strips it of moisture. Most women are at a loss as to how to keep their skin looking smooth and radiant. If you find yourself in the same dilemma, we can help you find a solution to this problem. (Also read: Tips to protect skin from UV damage: Best skincare routine for young adults )
Dr. Karishma Kagodu, MBBS, MS- General Surgery, MCh- Plastic Surgery shared with HT Digital six winter skincare secrets tailored for Indian winters, ensuring your skin remains radiant and well-nurtured despite the seasonal adversities.
One of the primary challenges our skin faces during winter is dehydration. Warm dry air indoors and the cold air outside can rob our skin of its moisture. Counteract this by incorporating hydration into your skincare routine. Choose a rich, moisturizing cream or oil-based moisturizer that will create a protective layer to lock in moisture. Moreover, you can also add a hydrating serum to the routine to give your skin an extra boost of moisture.
While it's essential to keep your skin clean, harsh cleansers can strip away the natural oils that help maintain its balance. During winter, switch to a gentle, hydrating cleanser that effectively removes impurities without leaving your skin feeling dry or irritated. Look for cleansers with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin to add an extra layer of hydration.
The misconception that sunscreen is only necessary during the summertime is a skincare myth that deserves debunking. UV rays are present year-round, and the snow can reflect these rays, intensifying their impact on the skin. Therefore, continue to apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30, even on cloudy winter days. This not only protects your skin from sun damage but also prevents premature aging.
Peeling or exfoliation is an important process for removing dead skin cells and promoting cell turnover even during the winter season. Nevertheless, a cautious approach is called for with regard to exfoliation during winter. Use gentle exfoliants with AHAs or BHAs so as not to strip your skin off its natural moisture. Exfoliate once or twice per week to maintain a healthy balance.
During winter, give your skin some extra love by including overnight treatments in your routine. Overnight masks or hydrating serums that contain hyaluronic acid and vitamin E work wonders while you sleep. These treatments help in rejuvenating your overall appearance as they promote recovery of the damaged cells, leading to a glowing and radiant complexion when you wake up.
Remember that healthy skin starts from within. Ensure that you constantly take lots of water to maintain good hydration. Also, introduce some high omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin-based food products. Such nutrients are beneficial to the skin, with the requisite components that form a gorgeous appearance.
Although winter might bring a chill to the air, your skin can remain warm, hydrated, and radiant with the right skincare routine. Embrace these winter skin care secrets in order to keep nourishing and protecting your skin all through the season. Prioritizing hydration, selecting suitable products, and maintaining an overall healthy skin care approach will have you on a pathway to enjoying good skin, regardless of how cold it is outside.

LIFESTYLE,How fasting fish could help scientists make us live longer,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/how-fasting-fish-could-help-scientists-make-us-live-longer-101702127710709.html,"Fasting: Humans have been doing it for centuries. But there's a lot we still don't know about its benefits and drawbacks. In a new episode of the DW podcast Science Unscripted, Conor Dillon and Gabriel Borrud discussed a studyfrom the Max Planck Institute on Aging in Cologne, Germany, that investigates what happens when fish fast. Conor and Gabe spoke with the institute's director, Adam Antebi. This interview is an excerpt from our podcast Science Unscripted. If you are interested in the full interview (and want to see how fasting could impact our lifespan too), you can watch this episode of Science Unscripted on YouTube. Or you can subscribe to the audio podcast.
Adam Antebi: A lot of people are engaging in intermittent fasting or caloric restriction because it has health benefits. It seems to lower blood glucose and reduce cholesterol and reduce, in some cases, age-related disease. I think there are clear health benefits for many humans and model organisms as well. The question is, though, is it true at all ages and for all people?
Actually, it started before us. This is work from other people. If you look at mice and you try to do diet restriction in older age, they don't respond as well. They don't get the benefits. And it's not understood why. It's also true even with humans, that if you lower protein early in life, you get health benefits. But later in life it seems those health benefits seem to go away to some extent. So we use the killifish as our model system, because this fish only lives about six to eight months and we can in real time see the impact of fasting in young and old animals and the effect it has on the lifespan of the animal.
So, basically, if I fast early in life, it's going to influence me, usually with a positive effect. And later in life, either not at all or not as much. And with a fish you can do that over the course of eight months. ""Later life"" with the fish would be their sixth month or something?
It's more like four and a half, five months where we start these experiments. You know, a lot of people want to lose weight. Fasting or reducing calories or having intermittent fasting is a good way to lose weight. And so that's beneficial. But if your goal is to preserve your muscle, this is really where the questions start to arise. And in a young person, they can probably maintain their muscle mass. In older people, it becomes an issue, because one of the things about aging is you tend to lose muscle sarcopenia. And so fasting could have a detrimental effect. So, we really wanted to explore this in a rigorous way in these fish.
It was quite a surprise. We expected that the young fish would perform better than the old fish. But what we saw was, when we fasted young fish, there were changes in genes that go up and down. When we looked at older animals, the number of genes that went up and down were much smaller. And we thought at first, well, maybe they just don't respond to the fasting part. But what we found was that they don't respond to the feeding part, and they seem to be stuck in this permanent fasting trap even though they're ingesting food. They're really anabolic resistant in many ways.
When you're fasting, you turn down protein synthesis. You usually build proteins for all sorts of activities in your body. But when you fast, you tune that down because you don't have as many resources to build. You also suppress energy metabolism, and you also start to break down fats and glucose for energy you need. When you're fed, a lot of that's reversed. You turn on protein synthesis, you turn on the fat production. You gear up for growth basically.
What's also very interesting is when you fast those old fish, they show signs of increased inflammation above and beyond what you normally have with aging. And so this sounds to us like it's a detrimental effect to fast an old fish, because you're increasing the amount of inflammation. And this can be detrimental to many of the tissues that you're looking at.
What we really want to understand is why does that happen and what is the mechanism. And one of the things that we discovered from our data, looking what genes were going up and down, was that there's this energy sensor called the AMP activated kinase. It detects low energy and tries to increase the energy production to keep things in balance. What we noticed is that this enzyme, this energy sensor is made of three subunits. One of them is called the gamma subunit. And what we saw was quite striking. The gamma one subunit was going up in the fed state. In young animals, gamma two subunit was going up in the fasted state. They were in this inverse relationship. And with aging gamma two is always up, the gamma one never comes on. We think that this fasting-feeding cycle is very important for the health. You must turn up gamma two during fasting and turn up gamma one during the feeding stage.
Yeah. This is why we use these model genetic organisms. Because we can manipulate them genetically very easily. Our idea was, if the gamma one is low in an aged fish, why not activate it genetically and see what happens to the fasting response and what happens to the metabolic health.
Remarkably, what you see is that a young animal had a normal fasting feeding response. And in an old animal they also had a youthful fasting repeating response. And it looks perfect. They have much lower levels of inflammation. They don't break down fat, they synthesize it. And most of all, their energy metabolism seems to be up.
Yeah. That's the most amazing thing. This one amino acid change caused these fish to live about 10% to 20% longer. And it's also not only that they live longer, but if you look in the different tissues of this fish, they look much more youthful. For example, if you look at regeneration of the fin, there's a lot more regeneration going on in those older animals. We think this is a really cool result. And now we have this long-lived, more healthy fish that we can study in detail and get it more mechanisms.
Well genetically not, but maybe pharmacologically. That would be one of the goals. But let me address your question in another way. Do we see the same kind of dynamics in humans? And I would say we haven't fully addressed that. But from what we can see in the data that we have looked at is that in humans, the gamma one, like in the killifish, goes down with aging.
We did a very nice collaborative study with some of the geriatricians here at University of Cologne at the clinics. They're looking at people and their frailty and ability to function in old age. We found that, if you look at the level of gamma one expression in those people, in the frailest individuals, the gamma one is the lowest. When gamma one is low, they're the frailest. And when gamma one is higher, they're the healthiest.
We think it could be a biomarker for health and longevity in humans. That needs to be determined. And right now, we don't know if there's a causal effect. And there are a lot of questions that remain to be answered. But there might be human connection.

On this important day, the world is reminded of the fundamental freedoms and rights to which every human being is entitled, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religion or any other distinction. On this day, all stakeholders in the national and international community are reminded and given an opportunity to reflect on their past and future actions and responsibilities and to strive for the promotion and protection of human rights. On this Human Rights Day, let us reflect on the fundamental importance of human rights for every individual and use them as a daily guide to pursue justice, equality, peace and freedom for all. (Also read: Utpanna Ekadashi 2023: When is Utpanna Ekadashi? Correct date, timings, rituals, significance and all you need to know )
The theme for Human Rights Day 2023 is ""Freedom, Equality and Justice for All"". In the decades since the ratification of the UDHR, human rights have become more widely recognised and protected around the world. The declaration has served as the cornerstone for a system of human rights protection that is growing and reaching out to more vulnerable populations, including migrants, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was ratified by the UN General Assembly on this day in 1948, known as Human Rights Day. Human Rights Day was formally established in 1950 when the Assembly adopted resolution 423(V), which called upon all States and interested organisations to observe 10 December that year as Human Rights Day. The United Nations Postal Administration's commemorative Human Rights Day stamp, issued in 1952, was pre-ordered by some 200,000 people, indicating the day's popularity.
Although not legally binding, the Declaration of Human Rights, with its comprehensive list of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights, served as the impetus for the creation of more than 60 human rights instruments, which together set the global standard for human rights. Today's universal agreement among all United Nations Member States on the fundamental human rights outlined in the Declaration further strengthens it and underscores the importance of human rights in our daily lives.
The Day serves as a powerful reminder of the fundamental rights and freedoms that belong to every individual, regardless of background, and underscores the collective responsibility to uphold and protect these rights. It is a call to action, urging nations, organisations and individuals to promote equality, justice and dignity for all, and to foster a world in which human rights are universally respected, protected and celebrated.

The actor, who is also celebrating his birthday today, bared it all in the photos where he was seen taking a dip in the river and cooking with a fire set near a tree. This did not go down well with actor Abhinav Shukla, who criticised Vidyut for setting fire next to a tree which was very much alive. (Also read: Vidyut Jammwal ditches all his clothes and luxuries for Himalayan retreat, fans say his pics will set internet ablaze)
It all started when Vidyut took to his Instagram to share a set of pictures from his retreat that has become a yearly ritual to him over the years. In a long note, the actor said, ""My retreat to the Himalayan ranges - ‘the abode of the divine’ started 14 years ago. Before I realised, it became an integral part of my life to spend 7-10 days alone- every year. Coming into the wilderness from a life of luxury and adulation, I enjoy finding my solitude and realising the importance of knowing ‘Who I am Not’ which is the first step of knowing ‘who am I’ as well as fending for myself in the quiet luxuries provided by nature. I am most comfortable outside my comfort zone and I tune into the natural frequency of nature, and I imagine myself as the satellite dish antenna- receiving & emitting vibrations of happiness and love.""

Reacting to a report of Vidyut's post on X (formerly Twitter), Abhinav criticised the actor and said, “Good connecting with nature, what to eat and wear is purely a personal choice! But setting up fire next to a live tree, burning it along is not nature-friendly and against camping/ outdoor ethics (until survival requires it). That stone stove looks pretty inefficient, Dakota fire would have been great if you had luxury of 6-7 days! I feel #bushcraft should be taught in schools!” Vidyut has not responded to Abhinav's comment yet.
He will be next seen in the film Crakk, which also stars Nora Fatehi, Arjun Rampal and Amy Jackson. It is set to release in theatres next year on February 24.

ENTERTAINMENT,Triptii Dimri reacts to rumours of signing south films after Animal: Have not…,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/triptii-dimri-talks-about-being-tagged-national-crush-after-animal-says-more-people-are-now-watching-qala-bulbbul-101702213813697.html,"‘National crush Triptii Dimri- as she is being tagged right now- says she is feeling so many things right now, which she cannot even describe in words. “I have had sleepless nights post the film, due to the excitement,” she gushes.
And the reason is the adulation she has received for a small role in Animal, opposite Ranbir Kapoor. “It was an instant yes when I heard the back story of the film. Sandeep Reddy Vanga sir, I was told by an assistant during an ad shoot, wanted to cast me in this film. I said yes, but then nothing happened for a year. Then he called me and we spoke about life. He said ‘Triptii, I am not going to send you this character by saying it’s the lead. All I want to say is it’s a negative character but I don’t want you to play it like that. When the audiences see on screen, they should never feel you have a motive’ That was it for me,” she adds.
The 29-year-old, who has earlier garnered acclaim for films such as Qala and Bulbbul, seems to have found her breakthrough into mainstream cinema as well with Animal. But what she is happier about is that people will now watch her other projects because of her newfound fame. “I think there will be a shift in my career now. I always wanted films like Qala to reach out to a lot of people. It did earlier too, but now so many people are messaging me saying ‘we watched your films’, it’s such a special feeling. I always wished for people to watch them,” says Dimri, whose Instagram following shot up from 660K to a whopping 2.6 million within a week. “More than me, my family has been excited. Every time it goes up even a little, they send it to me,” she exclaims.
Rumours are now rife that she is being flooded with offers from south films, and in fact already signed Spirit with Prabhas. She reacts and says, “I haven’t signed anything right now. I would love to get offers from there though.”

And you know how it is with the Indian Legal System. This case will take years. This man will be on bail even if convicted like Gurmeet Ram Rahim. This is all there is. The man in the white shirt is Jagadeesh.""

Earlier, news agency PTI quoted the police as saying that the actor was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly abetting the suicide of a woman junior artiste. He has been accused of threatening and blackmailing the 34-year-old woman after ""taking her photo along with a man"", they said. The woman died on November 29 and a case was filed.
Based on the findings during the investigation the police altered the section to abetment to suicide and arrested him. The woman's father had complained to the Panjagutta police station. He allegedly clicked her pictures without consent, then harassed her by showing them and threatening to release them on social media. The junior artiste took her life on November 29, as per reports.
As per reports, the police had sent the body for post-mortem. The Punjagutta police filed a case and later took Jagadeesh into custody. Later, the court directed to keep Jagadeesh in remand for 14 days.
Jagadeesh rose to fame when he played Pushpa Raj’s loyal friend Keshava, in the 2021 film Pushpa: The Rise. He made his debut in 2018 with the film Nirudyoga Natulu. He went on to act in hit films like the 2019 Mallesham and George Reddy and the 2020 film Palasa 1978.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga's action film Animal has minted over ₹660.89 crore gross worldwide in just nine days of its release. The film also features Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol and is being slammed for his alleged toxicity and misogyny.

Many also called out the misogynistic treatment of the women in the Sandeep Reddy Vanga film. In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Triptii has now revealed that her parents were 'taken aback' by her much-talked-about intimate scene with Ranbir Kapoor, and told her that she 'shouldn't have done it."" (Also read: Triptii Dimri on how Ranbir Kapoor, Sandeep Reddy Vanga made sure she was comfortable shooting intimate scene in Animal)
Speaking about how her parents reacted to her intimate scene in Animal, Triptii said, ""My parents got a little taken aback. (They said) ‘We have never seen something like this in films and you have done it.’ It took them time to get over that scene. They were very sweet to me though. They were like, ‘You shouldn’t have done that… but it’s okay. As parents, we will obviously feel this.’”
The actor further added how she told her parents that it was her responsibility as an actor to make that part as honest as possible. “I told them I am not doing anything wrong. It’s my job and as long as I am comfortable and safe, I don’t see any problem in that. I am an actor and I have to be 100 percent honest with the character that I play and I did that,” she said.
Triptii has earlier said that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga told her about each and every scene while talking about her part, and made her comfortable on set. The actor also revealed that even though she knows that the scenes have sparked debate, but humans also have a dark and selfish side.
In one particular scene from Animal, Ranbir’s character Rannvijay Singh aka Vijay asks Triptii's Zoya to lick his shoe to prove that she truly loves him, after she is revealed as a mole. As Triptii she might not lick the shoe, but it was her character Zoya who would do it because she felt guilty for using that person eventually.
Animal has emerged as the highest grossing film at the box office of Ranbir's career. The film chronicles the toxic relationship between Rannvijay (Ranbir) and his father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor). It also stars Bobby Deol and Rashmika Mandanna in key roles.

The House of Gucci star was joined by singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo as the musical guest. The 20-year-old singer took the stage for the second time this week and performed hits like Vampire and All American B**ch. Driver's act was filled with hilarious jokes including a list of Christmas wishes to Santa.
The 40-year-old actor took the stage to deliver his opening monologue while playing a piano. Driver revealed some of his oddly specific wishes for Christmas as he recited a letter to Santa while playing the instrument. “Hey, Santa! It’s me, Adam Driver from the nice list and also Girls,” the Ferrari star said, adding, “I turned 40 this year, Santa, so I’d like five pairs of Chinos.”

A post shared by Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl)
He then made a hilarious reference to portraying Kylo Ren in Star Wars as he joked about not killing Han Solo. “I’d like people to stop coming up to me on the street saying, ‘You killed Han Solo,'” Driver said. “I didn’t kill Han Solo. Wokeness killed Han Solo,” he added. The Last Duel actor contemplated on what else he wants for Christmas and said, “You know those TikToks where it’s like those couples who do pranks on each other? Can you kill those people?”
For her first act, the Driver's License hitmaker performed a stripped-down piano rendition of her song Vampire. She sang in a soft melodious voice, giving an emotional tone to the song. Interestingly, Rodrigo wore alphabet rings that spelt out GUTS, which is the name of her second studio name.

A post shared by Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl)
In contrast to the first song, Rodrigo spiced up her second act as she performed All American B**ch. With a dramatic approach, she slashed the blood-red cake with a knife and smeared it on her face. The stage was filled with props ranging from tea cups to other confectionaries. At the end of the performance, Rodrigo stuck out her tongue at the cameras.

ENTERTAINMENT,RGV on Animal's 'mega box office success': Indians are not the same Indians,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/ram-gopal-varma-animal-mega-box-office-success-indians-are-not-the-same-indians-101702196030794.html,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol-starrer Animal has been unstoppable at the box office, worldwide and in India. Director Ram Gopal Varma (RGV), who is known for making films that often divide public opinion, has been regularly tweeting about Animal. On Sunday, he took to X once again to share his two cents about the action film, which has been slammed by a section of the audience for promoting violence against women as well as toxic masculinity. Also read: RGV lauds Sandeep Reddy Vanga for Animal, says the film is mental therapy for film industry
Sharing his 'five takeaways for the people for India from Animal', Ram Gopal Varma began by tweeting, ""1. Indians are not the same Indians, what the earlier Indians used to think. 2. If films are believed to be an art form and reflect culture, Animal has redefined culture and destroyed what was earlier called art.""
The filmmaker further opened up about the box office success of Animal, which crossed ₹600 crore gross worldwide in only eight days and has now grossed ₹660.89 crore worldwide in nine days. Ram Gopal Varma said the film's success was proof that 'animals are hidden in all of us'. He said the Animal box office collections make clear that all Indians love and respect Sandeep Reddy Vanga, 'a not to be loved and respected director'.
Ram Gopal Varma continued to write in his tweet, “3. Every Indian is now exposed to each other Indian in terms of what kind of ANIMALS are hidden in all of us. 4. The mega box office proves that all Indians now love and respect a not-to-be-loved and respected director (Sandeep Reddy Vanga). 5. All Indians now realise that all Indians have grown up (folded hands emojis).”

A couple of days after Animal's release on December 1, Ram Gopal Varma shared a long note detailing what he thought of the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial.
He wrote in a statement he shared on X, “There will be massive fights over the content and the character of Ranbir in Animal long after its box office run is over and I truly believe it can also trigger a cultural overhaul due to the way Sandeep has ripped off the clothes of moral hypocrisy with his bare naked honesty. That is because Animal is not merely a film... it is a social statement.”

As per trade analyst Ramesh Bala, the film has minted over ₹660.89 crore worldwide in nine days of its release. Fronted by Ranbir Kapoor, the film was released worldwide on December 1 in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. (Also Read | Ranbir Kapoor's on-screen sister Saloni Batra admits Animal characters are flawed: 'We can’t be preaching')
Taking to X on Sunday, Ramesh Bala shared a poster and tweeted, ""The unstoppable journey of Animal continues with yet another day of shattering box office records! This cinematic spectacle garners a marvellous ₹660.89 crore worldwide in nine days and there is no stopping! Produced by Bhushan Kumar, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Triptii Dimri.""

Though the film is running successfully in theatres, a section of critics and viewers have criticised the film calling it misogynistic and graphically violent. The film was given A certificate by the CBFC ahead of its release. Apart from Ranbir, it also features Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna, Triptii Dimri, Suresh Oberoi and Prem Chopra.
Recently, speaking with news agency PTI, Bobby said, ""There’s good and evil in every human being and what gets the evil out of you is some situation. As an actor, you think as a character. 'I’m doing nothing wrong, I’m right in whatever I do'. You forget how to judge what is right and wrong.”
Animal showcases a violent world set against the backdrop of a troubled relationship between Ranbir's character Ranvijay Singh and his father Balbir Singh, played by Anil Kapoor. Ranbir's character is protective and obsessive about his father's love and is seen threatening everybody who comes in the way of his love for his father.
The movie is produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar's T-Series, Murad Khetani's Cine1 Studios and Pranay Reddy Vanga's Bhadrakali Pictures. Animal is a three-hour-21-minute-long film. The film was released in theatres and competed at the box office with Meghna Gulzar's Sam Bahadur.

The video captures candid glimpses of Shora from different places. While one features her dancing inside a vanity van, another has her with goofy expressions and a coffee in her hand. From singing and dancing to riding a bicycle and travelling, Shora seems to be quite close with her father.

A post shared by Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin._siddiqui)
The clip also comes with several throwback photos of little Shora and Nawazuddin from her childhood days. It also had some beautiful photos of the star kid from her recent times. Sharing them all, Nawazuddin added the Dua Lipa song Be The One in the background and wrote in the caption, “Happiest birthday Shora.”
Soon after he shared the video, many celebrities wished Shora. Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap commented, “Janmadin ki mubarak (happy birthday).”
“So beautiful,” wrote Shora. A fan wrote, “So pretty little lady... attractive like father and beautiful like mother All the good vibes sent.” Another said, “She is so beautiful and her eyes are expressive.""
Nawazuddin has two kids with Aaliya Siddiqui – daughter Shora and son Yaani. The couple was headed for divorce amid a property dispute last year, however, they settled the matter. Shora is currently pursuing her studies and stays with Aaliya, who has now changed her name to Aaliya Anand Pandey.
Aaliya participated in Bigg Boss OTT 2. She previously said that she was quitting social media and the industry after her dispute with Nawazuddin made news. She told the Times of India in September, “My daughter, Shora is 13 and she was glued to the phone. I realised that if I don't quit social media, she will not. I think the kids of today's generation are going in the wrong direction. Also, I have not just quit social media, but I quit the industry as well. I just directed a short film, but now I don't want to do anything else but dedicate my time to the kids.”

Now, as per a new report by Us Weekly, a source has confirmed that 'she’s really happy' with Perry, after her divorce from singer Joe Jonas a couple of months ago. (Also read: GoT Star Sophie Turner confirms new love with this British aristocrat Peregrine Pearson amid divorce from Joe Jonas)
As per the new report, the source told Us Weekly that the actor, 27, ‘has been casually dating a few people since her split from Joe’, and ‘really seems to like spending time with Perry,’ and that they have ‘become progressively closer.’ The source also added that it might be ‘too soon to tell if there’s long term potential,’ but it seems like ‘things might be headed that way’.

On Friday, Sophie and Perry were spotted cosying up and packing in the PDA in London. The two seemed to be in a light mood, grinning from ear to ear and holding hands as they also embraced each other. Perry, the 29-year-old media empire heir with a family net worth exceeding £224 million, has recently undergone a breakup of his own with Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark.
The reports of Sophie's casual romance arrives a month after she reached an 'amicable resolution' over the custody of his children- Willa, 3, and Delphine, 14 months, that she shares with singer Joe Jonas. Sophie and Joe filed for divorce on September 5 after four years of marriage. A few days after the reports caught media attention, Sophie was even seen hanging out with singer-songwriter and Joe's ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift.
The official statement on the split read: ""Statement from the two of us: After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.""

ENTERTAINMENT,Julia Stiles recreates heartfelt scene from ‘10 Things I Hate About You’,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/tv/julia-stiles-recreates-heartfelt-scene-from-90s-comedy-10-things-i-hate-about-you-in-new-york-city-101702194777356.html,"A nostalgic moment that transported fans back to the late ‘90s, Julia Stiles revived a memorable scene from the cult classic film ’10 Things I Hate About You' during her appearance at the Mash-Up Americans Book Festival in New York City.
The 42-year-old actress stepped onto the stage and delivered the poignant love poem her character, Kat Stratford, wrote for Patrick Verona, played by the late Heath Ledger, in the 1999 teen movie inspired by Shakespeare’s ‘The Taming of the Shrew.’
The festival’s venue, The Greene Space, shared a video on Instagram capturing Stiles’ emotional performance.

Dressed in a floral silk blazer, with her blond hair neatly tied back, Stiles recited the poem, visibly moved by the final lines that encapsulate the bittersweet feelings of her lovelorn teenage character: “But mostly, I hate the way I don’t hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.” The audience’s cheers echoed the sentiment.

A post shared by The Greene Space at WNYC/WQXR (@thegreenespacenyc)
Stiles reminisced on the People in the '90s podcast in 2021 about Ledger’s graciousness. She praised his supportive nature, recalling how he stepped back to let her shine, saying, “He wasn’t trying to compete with me,” and “He stood back and he was like, this is your scene.” Ledger’s humility and confidence allowed Stiles to deliver a powerful performance, acknowledging his own standout moments in the film, such as the unforgettable singing and dancing sequence on the school steps.
Stiles’ reflections on her experience with Ledger highlight the rarity of such generosity in the industry, where the spotlight is often fiercely contested. Her appreciation for Ledger’s approach is a testament to his character and talent, even at the onset of his career.

The film marked a significant moment in her career, presenting a strong, feisty, and unapologetic teenage female character that stood out to her and evidently, to viewers as well..

ENTERTAINMENT,Leave the World Behind review: Julia Roberts fares well in apocalyptic thriller,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/leave-the-world-behind-movie-review-julia-roberts-mahershala-ali-apocalyptic-thriller-ethan-hawke-netflix-101702191292889.html,"Leave the World Behind movie review: ""I f***ing hate people,"" Julia Roberts' Amanda Sanford proclaims at the very beginning of Leave the World Behind, the new Netflix release this week, directed by Sam Esmail, the writer and director of Mr Robot. Amanda has planned an impromptu getaway for her family, which includes her husband Clay (Ethan Hawke) and their two children- Archie (Charlie Evans) and Rose (Farrah Mackenzie). Yet, the world around her slowly begins to disintegrate – and the ambiguities pile up one after the other, leaving her (along with the viewers) in a constant sense of dread. (Also read: Leave the World Behind: Julia Roberts feels ‘honoured’ to star in Netflix's latest thriller film)
There's a M Night Shayamalan-esque vibe in the DNA of Leave the World Behind, which starts off with immense promise. The Stanfords reach their destination, and shortly head to the beach. Rose spots an oil tanker first, and eventually realises that it is headed straight towards the shore. Horrified, they run for their lives, as the huge ship crashes on the shore. By evening, there's a knock at the door. What happens next, when the owners of the same vacation rental choose to return early and wish to stay along with the family?
The owner here in question is GH Scott (Mahershala Ali) and his daughter Ruth (Myha'la). Scott informs that there is a blackout in the city and so they chose to drive back to their house instead. Amanda immediately doubts them, and is aghast that Clay doesn't. Yet, the next morning, when Amanda does momentarily notice a news alert about a potential blackout and some hacking at work that may indicate a national emergency, she's sure something is afoot. The resultant scenes, brilliantly captured by cinematographer Tod Campbell, work wonders in amplifying the urgency of the topsy-turvy situation.

The racial tension between the two families is the subtext that informs the larger, more unnerving displacement at work. The issue, which develops in the second half, is how Esmail is unable to probe the questions that arise out of the turmoil, placing a bigger emphasis in the abnormality of the situations that take place in quick succession. Leave the World Behind stops short of making those building blocks first – there's a lot left to uncover in the history of the Stanfords (which later feels one-note in small revelations), so as to intersect the growing sense of discomfort with them along the way.
Julia Roberts is perhaps the furthest she has been as an actor to play someone so despicable and annoying on screen. She nails the self-centered arrogance of Amanda, and is a delight to watch as the emergency leaves her concerned. Ethan Hawke matches her energy with a dry sense of agency in Clay. But it is Mahershala Ali, who emerges as the scene-stealer, whose uneasy body language suggests more than what the script offers to his character. The scene with Ali and Roberts is the one that really sticks.
Leave the World Behind is ambitious in design and moves ahead with a prevailing sense of dread. I was especially aghast about the way it chose to end so impishly, erasing the severity and resistance altogether. Still, there are important questions thrown here, which could have landed better if the treatment was less defensive in approach.

I vibrate at the frequency of COMPASSION. I vibrate at the frequency of DETERMINATION. I vibrate at the frequency of ACHIEVEMENT. I vibrate at the frequency of ACTION. It is here that I create the energy I want to surround myself with and come back home, ready to experience a new chapter in my life - Reborn.

Calling the report by The Intercept fake and completely fabricated, the ministry said there was no such memo. ""This is part of a sustained disinformation campaign against India.

It claimed the memo was sent two months before Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed in Vancouver.
India-Canada relationship received a jolt after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that India was behind Hardeep Singh Nijjar's assassination. India rejected the claim and assured that it would cooperate in the investigation process if Canada provided evidence.

The income tax department raided the premises on Wednesday and found stacks of notes kept in almirah racks. The counting began but could not be finished in a day or two as the SBI branch where the notes were being counted had its normal operations too. The counting could be completed by the weekend, the staff said earlier.
The I-T raids were at the premises of Boudh Distilleries Private Limited across Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Neither the MP nor the company has issued any statement so far. The Congress said the party has no involvement in the MP's business and he should explain this huge amount of cash.
The counting created a spectacle as this became the largest cash haul in a single operation in the country. The SBI branch where the counting took place received 176 bags full of cash. Three banks were roped in for the counting process. 40 currency counting machines were brought in. Initially, there was a shortage of machines as the ones in the counting operation gave in.
The counting involved nine teams of about 80 people from the tax department and various banks and they worked 24X7 in shifts. After 10 cash-stuffed almirahs were found, another team of 200 officials, including security personnel, drivers and other staff, joined in.
BJP's Amit Malviya shared a screenshot of Dhiraj Sahu's old tweet in which he exclaimed how there still was so much black money in the country even after demonetisation. ""Dhiraj Prasad Sahu has a dark sense of humour,"" Malviya tweeed.


""I feel pained seeing so much corruption and black money in the country even after noteban. This is beyond my understanding how people can accumulate so much of black money. Only Congress can uproot corruption from the party,"" Dhiraj Prasad Sahu tweeted in 2022.


""Imagine how much one Congress MP has looted that it takes almost an army of personnel to count the loot. Now multiply it with Congress’ 60 years of power & 1000s of MPs. It runs into tens of thousands of crores. Congress is corruption ki beemari! The disease of corruption,"" BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said.


Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday spoke about the issue as he questioned the silence of the INDIA parties like SP, DMK, JDU. ""It can be now understood as to why the allegation against the Modi government that it is misusing investigation agencies was made.It was because of the fear that their corruption will be exposed,"" Amit Shah said. PM Modi too earlier commented on the massive cash haul and said it is PM Modi's guarantee that every penny has to be returned to the public.

The five-judge constitution bench, including Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, and Surya Kant, will deliver the judgment on Monday. The apex court reserved the judgment on September 5 after a 16-day argument session.
Attorney General R Venkataramani, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, and senior advocates Harish Salve, Rakesh Dwivedi, V Giri, and others have represented the Centre and intervenors supporting the abrogation of Article 370.
Senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subramanium, Rajeev Dhavan, Zaffar Shah, Dushyant Dave, and others, presented their case on behalf of the petitioners.

Lawyers contested on various issues, including the constitutional validity of the Centre's decision on August 5, 2019, to abrogate Article 370, the validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, challenges to the Governor's and President's rule, and the extension of President's rule in the former state on July 3, 2019.
Numerous petitions challenging the Article 370 abrogation and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which created Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as Union territories, were referred to the Constitution bench in 2019.
During the hearing, the apex court asked who can recommend the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir when no constituent Assembly, the concurrence of which is required before taking such a step, exists there.
Supreme Court also asked how can a provision (Article 370), which was specifically mentioned as temporary in the Constitution, become permanent after the tenure of the Jammu and Kashmir constituent Assembly came to an end in 1957.
The central government said that the abrogation of Article 370 was not a ""constitutional fraud"" and aligned with the legal framework.
It argued that the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India was similar to the process followed by numerous princely states. It said many states joined through accession post-independence with conditionalities but after merger, their sovereignty was subsumed into India.
The central government said that Jammu and Kashmir's current status as a Union Territory is temporary and it is committed to restoring statehood.
The government said there is a positive transformation in Jammu and Kashmir, citing a decline in street violence since 2019. It claimed an ""unprecedented era of peace, progress, and prosperity,"" with normalcy returning to the region after years of turmoil.

Petitioners argued that Article 370, initially considered temporary, became permanent after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir.
They contended that Parliament lacked the authority to declare itself the legislature of J-K for Article 370's abrogation, citing Article 354 as insufficient for such power.
Pointing towards Article 370's clause 3, petitioners said that the Constituent Assembly's recommendation was crucial for its removal. Due to the Constituent Assembly's dissolution, required for abrogating Article 370, petitioners claimed that the provision could not be revoked.

The Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association presented in Supreme Court that upon acceding to India, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir retained territorial sovereignty over the state but not the sovereign power to rule and govern.
However, the association said, apart from defence, external affairs, and communication, all other powers were retained by the state for legislation and governance.

Briefing his cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu said he had told the leaders of France, Germany and other countries, ""You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas"".
This comes as fighting raged in the Gaza Strip in the third month of war between Israel and Hamas. Hamas from the Gaza Strip attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militant group took around 240 hostages -- 137 of whom remain in Gaza, officials have said. In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, launching a military offensive in Gaza that has killed at least 17,700 people, mostly women and children.
During a seven-day truce that expired on December 1, Hamas released 105 hostages including dozens of Israelis who were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Mediator Qatar said that efforts to secure a new truce and release more hostages were ongoing. The Qatar PM warned that the relentless Israeli bombardment was ""narrowing the window"" for a successful outcome.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization chief said that it will be all but impossible to improve the ""catastrophic"" health situation in Gaza. The emergency action, proposed by Afghanistan, Qatar, Yemen and Morocco, seeks passage into Gaza for medical personnel and supplies.

The actor, who is also celebrating his birthday today, bared it all in the photos where he was seen taking a dip in the river and cooking with a fire set near a tree. This did not go down well with actor Abhinav Shukla, who criticised Vidyut for setting fire next to a tree which was very much alive. (Also read: Vidyut Jammwal ditches all his clothes and luxuries for Himalayan retreat, fans say his pics will set internet ablaze)
It all started when Vidyut took to his Instagram to share a set of pictures from his retreat that has become a yearly ritual to him over the years. In a long note, the actor said, ""My retreat to the Himalayan ranges - ‘the abode of the divine’ started 14 years ago. Before I realised, it became an integral part of my life to spend 7-10 days alone- every year. Coming into the wilderness from a life of luxury and adulation, I enjoy finding my solitude and realising the importance of knowing ‘Who I am Not’ which is the first step of knowing ‘who am I’ as well as fending for myself in the quiet luxuries provided by nature. I am most comfortable outside my comfort zone and I tune into the natural frequency of nature, and I imagine myself as the satellite dish antenna- receiving & emitting vibrations of happiness and love.""

Reacting to a report of Vidyut's post on X (formerly Twitter), Abhinav criticised the actor and said, “Good connecting with nature, what to eat and wear is purely a personal choice! But setting up fire next to a live tree, burning it along is not nature-friendly and against camping/ outdoor ethics (until survival requires it). That stone stove looks pretty inefficient, Dakota fire would have been great if you had luxury of 6-7 days! I feel #bushcraft should be taught in schools!” Vidyut has not responded to Abhinav's comment yet.
He will be next seen in the film Crakk, which also stars Nora Fatehi, Arjun Rampal and Amy Jackson. It is set to release in theatres next year on February 24.

His presence at the crease proved crucial as he played the anchor role, allowing explosive batters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, and Rinku Singh to play their natural game and support India in securing a 4-1 series win against Matthew Wade's side.
In a revealing insight into the team dynamics during the Australia series, Gaikwad disclosed about an internal six-hitting competition within the squad. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh emerged as clear leaders in this friendly competition, showcasing their prowess in hitting boundaries. Yashasvi had exhibited an impressive strike rate of 168.29 in the T20I series against Australia, while Rinku, serving as the designated finisher in all five matches, displayed a brilliant strike rate of 175.
“There was a six-hitting competition between some of the players during the five-match T20I series against Australia. We didn’t have much to practice before the 1st T20I against South Africa, however, we had some before the series opener against Australia. We had fun and enjoyed hitting sixes during the practice, so obviously, I would say Rinku and Yashasvi are far ahead of all the others,” Gaikwad told Star Sports.
The opening pair of Jaiswal and Gaikwad faced a challenging start to the series against Australia, with the latter being dismissed for a duck without facing a delivery, courtesy of a run-out. However, the duo showcased resilience and made a stylish recovery, providing India with strong starts in the subsequent games. Gaikwad attributes the success of their partnership to Yashasvi's attacking style of play, emphasizing how it eases his role as the opening batter.
“Mostly, he is the one who goes for the attacking shots from Ball 1. Yashasvi is the kind of player who doesn’t hold back. I just have to figure out a few risks, and play according to what the team requires. Definitely, when someone like Yashasvi is going hard at the other end, it’s obviously crucial for me to hold the other end and let him express the way he wants to. I enjoy batting with him,” he added.

Pre-existing worries about the wicket were exacerbated by heavy overnight rain in Geelong, which seeped under the covers and affected the playing surface. Despite the initial concerns, the toss took place as Renegades captain Nic Maddinson chose to send the reigning champions, the Scorchers, in to bat.
The Scorchers faced early setbacks as their batters struggled with the unpredictable bounce, particularly evident when Australian's Aaron Hardie faced challenges, playing and missing on multiple occasions. The turning point occurred in the seventh over when Scorchers' player Inglis was hit in the groin by a Will Sutherland delivery that exhibited significant movement.
Shortly after, he inside-edged a similar ball that was dropped by the Renegades' wicketkeeper, Quinton de Kock. In the subsequent delivery, Inglis attempted a drive at a fuller delivery, resulting in the ball ballooning over his bat and reaching de Kock.
Expressing his dissatisfaction, Inglis showcased his disapproval towards umpires Ben Treloar and Simon Lightbody. Subsequently, the officials conferred to assess the pitch's condition and decided to take the players off the field with the Scorchers standing at 2-30 after 6.5 overs.
Watch:

Former Australia captain Aaron Finch told Fox Cricket the ball had “taken big divots out of the wicket … gripped the seam and was just bouncing ridiculously.”
The season had begun on December 7 with Brisbane Heat registering a 103-run win over Melbourne Stars at the Gabba. Renegades are yet to open their account in the league; they faced a narrow 8-run loss in their opening game to Sydney Sixers. The Scorchers, meanwhile, played for the first time in the new season on Sunday.
While Australia's limited-overs stars will be part of the BBL, the Test team will play against Pakistan in the first of three matches, starting December 14 at the Optus Stadium in Perth.

On the matter of consuming the fish, Fujioka said: “We don’t know for sure under what circumstances these fish were washed up, so I do not recommend” eating them.
Meanwhile, conspiracy theories are also being discussed on social media. Some netizens have linked it to the release of treated wastewater from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant.

CRICKET,‘We had a six-hitting competition…’: Gaikwad's key revelation on T20I squad,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/we-had-a-six-hitting-competition-those-two-were-far-ahead-gaikwads-fascinating-revelation-on-india-t20i-squad-101702221706730.html,"Ruturaj Gaikwad showcased formidable performances in India's recent T20I series against Australia; he had smashed a stellar century in the third T20I of the sreries, and scored 223 runs across five matches, playing a pivotal role in India's series victory. His presence at the crease proved crucial as he played the anchor role, allowing explosive batters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, and Rinku Singh to play their natural game and support India in securing a 4-1 series win against Matthew Wade's side.
In a revealing insight into the team dynamics during the Australia series, Gaikwad disclosed about an internal six-hitting competition within the squad. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh emerged as clear leaders in this friendly competition, showcasing their prowess in hitting boundaries. Yashasvi had exhibited an impressive strike rate of 168.29 in the T20I series against Australia, while Rinku, serving as the designated finisher in all five matches, displayed a brilliant strike rate of 175.
“There was a six-hitting competition between some of the players during the five-match T20I series against Australia. We didn’t have much to practice before the 1st T20I against South Africa, however, we had some before the series opener against Australia. We had fun and enjoyed hitting sixes during the practice, so obviously, I would say Rinku and Yashasvi are far ahead of all the others,” Gaikwad told Star Sports.
The opening pair of Jaiswal and Gaikwad faced a challenging start to the series against Australia, with the latter being dismissed for a duck without facing a delivery, courtesy of a run-out. However, the duo showcased resilience and made a stylish recovery, providing India with strong starts in the subsequent games. Gaikwad attributes the success of their partnership to Yashasvi's attacking style of play, emphasizing how it eases his role as the opening batter.
“Mostly, he is the one who goes for the attacking shots from Ball 1. Yashasvi is the kind of player who doesn’t hold back. I just have to figure out a few risks, and play according to what the team requires. Definitely, when someone like Yashasvi is going hard at the other end, it’s obviously crucial for me to hold the other end and let him express the way he wants to. I enjoy batting with him,” he added.

Abrar will be assessed for the second Test in Melbourne from December 26, it said. The third Test is in Sydney from January 3.

CRICKET,"""Class Player"": Babar Azam receives plaudits from Australia bowlers ahead of 1st Test",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/class-player-babar-azam-receives-plaudits-from-australia-bowlers-ahead-of-1st-test-101702215361633.html,"New Delhi [India], December 10 (ANI): Australia's star-studded bowling line-up showered praises on Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam, with a handful of them labelling the right-handed batter as a ""class player"".
With each passing day, the hype around the game continues to build up for the highly anticipated series between two cricketing giants.
The series will kick off on December 14 in Perth, when Pakistan will square off against Australia in the first Test of the three-match series.
Ahead of the clash, the former Pakistan captain received a lot of praise from Aussie bowlers with Pat Cummins stating that sending Babar won't be an easy task for them.
""So he's going to be hard work,"" Cummins said in Cricket Australia's video posted on Instagram.
Experienced pacer Josh Hazlewood called Babar a ""class player"" and added ""has been for a long time. Sort of burst on the scene in ODI cricket and then changed his game to be strong in the Test arena as well.""
""If you miss, he hurts you and sort of tries to put that pressure back on you as a bowler,"" Hazlewood added.
Australia's veteran spinner Nathan Lyon branded Babar as ""extremely talented"".
""He's got beautiful hands when he bats. He scored some runs. I think it was Gabba's last time he was up here. You always want to compete against the best players in the world and he's definitely one of them,"" Lyon said while praising Babar.
Left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc believes that the 29-year-old batter has a ""great batting temperament"" and called him as one of the ""world's best"".
""He's got all shots. He's someone who can build an innings or can be ultra-aggressive and take the game away and change the momentum. Hopefully, we can keep him quiet on this tour,"" the Aussie pacer asserted,"" Starc added.

CRICKET,Watch: BBL tie abandoned due to unsafe pitch as 'ridiculous' bounce stuns Inglis,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/watch-bbl-2023-match-abandoned-due-to-unsafe-pitch-conditions-after-ridiculous-bounce-stuns-josh-inglis-101702202524377.html,"A rare occurrence took place on Sunday at the 2023 Big Bash League, as the match between Melbourne Renegades and Perth Scorchers was abandoned due to unsafe pitch conditions at the GMHBA Stadium in Perth. Pre-existing worries about the wicket were exacerbated by heavy overnight rain in Geelong, which seeped under the covers and affected the playing surface. Despite the initial concerns, the toss took place as Renegades captain Nic Maddinson chose to send the reigning champions, the Scorchers, in to bat.
The Scorchers faced early setbacks as their batters struggled with the unpredictable bounce, particularly evident when Australian's Aaron Hardie faced challenges, playing and missing on multiple occasions. The turning point occurred in the seventh over when Scorchers' player Inglis was hit in the groin by a Will Sutherland delivery that exhibited significant movement.
Shortly after, he inside-edged a similar ball that was dropped by the Renegades' wicketkeeper, Quinton de Kock. In the subsequent delivery, Inglis attempted a drive at a fuller delivery, resulting in the ball ballooning over his bat and reaching de Kock.
Expressing his dissatisfaction, Inglis showcased his disapproval towards umpires Ben Treloar and Simon Lightbody. Subsequently, the officials conferred to assess the pitch's condition and decided to take the players off the field with the Scorchers standing at 2-30 after 6.5 overs.
Watch:

Former Australia captain Aaron Finch told Fox Cricket the ball had “taken big divots out of the wicket … gripped the seam and was just bouncing ridiculously.”
The season had begun on December 7 with Brisbane Heat registering a 103-run win over Melbourne Stars at the Gabba. Renegades are yet to open their account in the league; they faced a narrow 8-run loss in their opening game to Sydney Sixers. The Scorchers, meanwhile, played for the first time in the new season on Sunday.
While Australia's limited-overs stars will be part of the BBL, the Test team will play against Pakistan in the first of three matches, starting December 14 at the Optus Stadium in Perth.

CRICKET,Jay Shah keeps Rohit Sharma-T20WC ambiguity alive with major 'clarity' remark,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/jay-shah-keeps-rohit-sharma-t20-world-cup-ambiguity-alive-with-major-clarity-remark-101702182005905.html,"There is a lot of ambiguity over Rohit Sharma's future in T20I cricket and possible inclusion in India's T20 World Cup squad. Ideally, it would have been a no-brainer given that he still is India's all-format captain. But given that 36-year-old has been absent from the format for over a year, and continues to be away from T20Is with BCCI yet to decide India's squad for the Afghanistan T20I series in January, questions over his World Cup inclusion has been raised. And BCCI secretary Jay Shah kept the speculations alive when he addressed the issue on Saturday.
Rohit has been out of the T20I side of India since the T20 World Cup semifinal loss against England in November 2022. It was initially thought as the captain's way of having his entire focus on ODI cricket with the 50-over World Cup slated to happen on October at home, with Rohit himself indicating at the start of this year that he isn't done with T20Is yet. Post the ODI World Cup, it was expected that Rohit would return for the series against South Africa if not against Australia, but he was not named in the squad for either ODIs or T20Is.
Amid the rising speculation, Shah was asked to issue an clarification over BCCI's stance over the situation and if at all Rohit intended to return to T20Is. Speaking to media on the sidelines of the Women’s Premier League auction in Mumbai, he said: “What is the need to have clarity right now? It (T20 World Cup) is starting in June, we have the IPL before that and the series against Afghanistan.""
According to a report by Dainik Jagran earlier this week, Rohit had joined a virtual meeting from London, where he was enjoying some quality time with his family, where Shah was present along with vice president Rajeev Shukla, and treasurer Ashish Shelar. Rohit had reportedly asked the BCCI officials whether he is part of India's T20 World Cup plans, to which the trio along with head coach Rahul Dravid and the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee agreed unanimously.
The report further added that BCCI wanted Rohit to be part of the South Africa T20I series, but he requested a break from the entire white-ball leg of the tour. Rohit will return to action as a captain in the two-match Test series that is slated to begin on December 26.

CRICKET,"An electrician turned cricketer, who now dreams of playing with MS Dhoni",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/an-electrician-turned-cricketer-who-now-dreams-of-playing-with-ms-dhoni-the-muhammad-jawadullah-story-101702182572637.html,"On December 9, 2023, United Arab Emirates’ Muhammad Jawadullah prepped himself up the same way he does for every cricket match. As he stepped into the starry Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the occasion bore witness to his silent prayers; a nod to the divine and a heartfelt remembrance of his parents back home in Pakistan. Routine it may be for Jawadullah, but this was no ordinary game. It was the pinnacle of a cricketing journey so far, marked by a relocation to foreign lands, the challenges of adapting to a new culture, a notable absence of formal cricket training, and the pursuit of recognition amid the giants of the sport. In the final of the Abu Dhabi T10 League, Jawadullah stepped out donning the colours of the New York Strikers, ready to face off against the formidable Deccan Gladiators.
There were nerves, of course. Jawadullah admitted that before the tournament, he “feared” the format itself. “I feared being hit for fours and sixes off every delivery. But I trusted my process and have performed well,” he would say. Yet, when the final arrived, Jawadullah emerged not as the hesitant newcomer but as a seasoned professional, armed with skills and courage. Contributing figures of 1/16 in two overs, his efforts helped Strikers restrict the Gladiators to 91/5 before chasing down the score in with four balls remaining.
Jawadullah lifted the trophy – a first in his playing career. Hard as it may be to believe, he was yet to make a professional debut the same time last year.
--
Approximately 170km to the east of Abu Dhabi lies Al-Ain, the Emirates' largest inland city. Revered as the 'Garden City' for its flourishing greenery, Al-Ain is renowned for its Camel Souks, lush oases, and diverse wildlife. It was in this vibrant backdrop that Muhammad Jawadullah sowed the seeds of his cricketing ambitions upon his arrival in the Emirates in January 2020. Originating from a humble family near Mardan, nestled in the mountainous terrain of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Jawadullah's early life was defined by a lack of opportunities—whether in cricket or stable employment. Astonishingly, he hadn't even laid hands on a seasoned cricket ball before he set foot in the UAE.
“I only used to play with tennis ball earlier. But here in UAE, I got an opportunity to start playing with the hard ball,” he tells Hindustan Times in an exclusive chat.
Jawadullah secured a job as an electric contractor at Al Ain's renowned shooting club, but his fervor for the game continued to blaze brightly, even amid hardships. ""Those were challenging days. Balancing a nine-hour shift as an electrician with regular cricket matches was incredibly tough. I worked during the day and played cricket in the evenings, making it my daily routine,"" shares Jawadullah, his voice carrying the weight of those trying times.
On certain days, he found himself engaged in two-to-three consecutive club matches, earning around 100 Dirhams per game—an amount that helped make ends meet but came at a physical cost. The toll was evident, but cricket became his solace, the means through which he faced life's challenges head-on. Yet, as a cricketer, Jawadullah remained distant from formal training; most matches in Al Ain’s club cricket were played on unforgiving cemented surfaces, which restricted his growth as a fast bowler in his formative years.
Compounding these challenges was a significant gap in awareness about fitness and dietary considerations. While players his age were put on regular diet by physios in most cricket-playing nations, Jawadullah played regularly – for over two years – without structuralised focus on fitness and skills. In the absence of proper guidance, Jawadullah unknowingly teetered on the brink of injuries, facing the risk of physical setbacks even before formally embarking on his professional cricketing career.
The turning point for Jawadullah, however, finally came in April 2022, when UAE’s national cricket team – under the coaching of former India batter Robin Singh – organised nation-wide bowling trials. Close to 600 players turned up for the trials, including the left-armer from Pakistan. The story goes that Jawadullah, with just two deliveries, left such an indelible mark on the UAE support staff that they roped the left-arm talent into their camp, despite the fact that ICC rules don’t allow a player to represent the country until they have lived in the said country for at least three years.
Asked to conjure an in-swinging delivery on his first ball, Jawadullah executed the task flawlessly, immediately capturing the attention and admiration of the scouting team. Returning to his bowling mark, the next challenge was to deliver a well-executed bumper, and once again, Jawadullah left no room for disappointment.
His raw talent spoke volumes. Recognizing the potential, the support staff decided it would keep Jawadullah in the side as a net bowler and await the completion of his three-year residency in the UAE before formally incorporating him into the squad.
--

""Robin Singh did everything for me. I was recommended to the Sharjah Warriors because of that camp, and he brought me into the UAE team as well,” Jawadullah recalls as he looks back at the events that unfolded right before the turn to the current year.
Singh had taken over the role of head coach for the UAE cricket team in 2020. A key moment under his coaching arrived in 2022 when the team successfully qualified for the Men's T20 World Cup. However, the subsequent months saw a witnessed a stark decline in UAE’s performance. Robin Singh's periodic absences from coaching responsibilities, attributed to his commitments with the IPL franchise Mumbai Indians, became a source of added frustration within the UAE cricket community as well. Consequently, the former Indian cricketer chose to step down from his coaching – as well as a directorial – role, earlier this March.
But Robin Singh’s decision to hold a bowling trial in April 2022 did help unearth the left-armer Jawadullah, who was flown with the side in August the same year as a net bowler for the World Cricket League in Scotland – an international league organized by ICC for national teams without a Test status. Jawadullah grew in stature as a bowler, even clicking 140kph, as he began to receive formal training, consistently bowled with a season ball, and most importantly, had the professionals around him to monitor his fitness and workload.
In a fortuitous turn of events, the UAE saw its first global T20 league – the International T20 League (ILT20) – being introduced in January 2023 as well. One of the sides, Sharjah Warriors was on the lookouts for local bowling talents and R Sridhar, who was the director of cricket at the franchise, approached a member of the UAE’s support staff for the same. Jawadullah was an immediate recommendation. Warriors liked what they saw and added him into the roster, thus propelling the beginning of the youngster’s professional cricket career.
""Everyone was very happy when I was selected. My mother and father, and brother and sister, they were all very happy. My village did a grand welcome when I finally returned after 3 years,” Jawadullah says about the time he landed a professional contract with the Warriors. From playing in an amateur setup with largely cemented wickets a few months ago, Jawadullah was suddenly rubbing shoulders with World Cup winners like Moeen Ali and Marcus Stoinis, as well as star cricketers like Mohammad Nabi, Dawid Malan, and Chris Woakes, among others. Jawadullah did have to wait for his first wicket – it came in his fourth match in the league – but wasn’t overtly expensive in any of the previous three games, thus keeping captain Moeen’s faith. Eventually, he picked Alex Hales for his maiden scalp; how many can boast about dismissing a World Cup winner for their first-ever wicket in professional cricket?
Jawadullah played in 7 matches for the side in the tournament's maiden season, picking 5 wickets but registering an impressive economy rate of 7.47. Moeen Ali called him a find of the season, and the youngster was duly retained by the side ahead of the 2023/24 season. ""It was a very big thing for me, when Moeen Ali said that. I felt very proud, particularly because it was my first tournament,” recalls Jawadullah.
Immediately following the ILT20, Jawadullah received a maiden UAE call-up for the T20Is against Afghanistan. In the international stage, though, he didn’t have to wait long for his maiden wicket; Afsar Zazai, the Afghan wicketkeeper-batter, fell prey to a short-pitched delivery from Jawadullah on 48. Afghanistan did manage to win the game, but Jawadullah had already been taking massive strides in his cricketing career.

Even though it has been a year for Jawadullah in senior cricket, an unpolished bowling action remains a vivid reminder of his humble beginnings in the game. The distinct double hop in Jawadullah's action serves as evidence that he lacked formal training during his early cricketing days. Many cricket coaches would perceive this as a potential issue, and even Jawadullah himself acknowledges the unconventional nature of his bowling action with a mischievous smile on his face.
""It was my natural bowling action. I didn't even know that it was just the way my body went when I used to bowl like that back in Pakistan. Here, when I saw the actual footages of my bowling, I started laughing. But this is natural to me, and I won't change that,” says Jawadullah. And there is little need to change; He has picked 15 wickets in 12 T20Is, as well as 6 wickets in 5 fifty-over games for the UAE so far.
Following the series against Afghanistan, Jawadullah's cricketing journey soared to new heights as he earned a maiden ODI call-up spot for the series against West Indies. He was eventually selected for the 2023 ODI World Cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe as well, where a stellar performance against Nepal, where he claimed three wickets for 46 runs, showcased his growing prowess.
In the T20Is, Jawadullah solidified his position in the XI, and his breakthrough moment arrived during the bilateral series against New Zealand in August. In the first T20I, he dismissed Kiwi regulars Tim Seifert and Rachin Ravindra, contributing to his figures of 2/16 in four overs—the most economical among all bowlers. This remarkable performance played a pivotal role in UAE scripting a historic upset, as they triumphed over New Zealand by 7 wickets.
Following UAE’s win against Nepal in the tri-nation series later October, Jawadullah began preparations for the Abu Dhabi T10 League, where he was signed up by the New York Strikers. ""Thanks to god. I hadn't played in any league before this year. And in 2023 itself, I've played two; the ILT20 and now the T10. Earlier, I used to play in local leagues in Al-Ain and had to struggle hard towards achieving my targets. Now that I'm a professional cricketer, my focus has become more singular,” says the UAE star.

At one point in Pakistan’s history, not too long ago, the country cultivated fast bowlers with the precision of tending to a crop. While the 90s saw the famed Wasim Akram-Waqar Younis duo annihilating batting orders, the turn of the century witnessed the peak of the likes of Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Asif, and Mohammad Sami. Among the promising talents was Mohammad Amir, whose trajectory to becoming a world-class bowler was briefly interrupted by his involvement in spot-fixing.
Amir's return after a five-year ban saw him spearheading Pakistan's pace attack, leading them to victory in the 2017 Champions Trophy. While his standing with the team management fluctuated in recent years, his role in Pakistan's resurgence post the departure of legends like Shoaib Akhtar, Younis Khan, and Mohammad Yousuf remained unmistakable.
For emerging bowlers, especially left-armers like Jawadullah, Amir became a beacon to follow closely. Jawadullah didn't just track Amir's career from a distance. Fate smiled upon him when he found himself sharing the dressing room with the former Pakistani star during the Abu Dhabi T10 stint. To call this experience a dream come true for Jawadullah would be an understatement, as it marked an invaluable opportunity to glean insights from one of Pakistan's pace maestros.
""I thank to god for that (sharing dressing room with Amir). I was so happy with him being in my team. Whenever I faced any difficulty, I talked to him. It actually felt quite surreal… when someone who I looked up to as an idol praised my bowling,” Jawadullah stated.
With the way Jawadullah has progressed in his first year, there will undeniably be opportunities in overseas leagues for the star pacer. Like most, the UAE star does want to play in the Indian Premier League as well. When asked if there’s a favourite, he said with a sheepish smile, “Vo Dhoni ka team (MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings).”

CRICKET,"Chahar to miss first T20I against South Africa, doubtful for the series: Report",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/deepak-chahar-to-miss-first-t20i-against-south-africa-doubtful-for-the-series-101702209329904.html,"Senior seamer Deepak Chahar will reportedly not be considered for selection in the starting eleven for the opening T20I between India and South Africa in Durban on Sunday. The reason for his absence is personal, as he is yet to join the squad due to pressing family matters. Chahar is currently at home, taking a break from cricket due to a close family member's health issues. This situation has led to his absence in the fifth and final T20 International against Australia in Bengaluru last Sunday, as he had to urgently return home after receiving news about the illness of a family member.
""Deepak hasn't yet joined the team in Durban as a close family member needed urgent hospitalisation. He had taken permission for a break as he needed to attend to his family member. He may or may not join the squad depending on his family member's health in coming days,"" a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity.
The report furthr states that BCCI believes Deepak Chahar may not be in an “best frame of mind” until the complete recovery of his family member, and that if he prefers not to join the team at this time, he will be granted the necessary exemption.
The 31-year-old seasoned player from Rajasthan holds the record for the best T20 International figures of 6/7. His prolonged absence due to injury has previously impacted the balance of the T20 squad over the past two years.
On a positive note, the trio that represented the Indian team during the ODI World Cup – Shubman Gill, Kuldeep Yadav, and vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja, have returned to the squad. They were on a holiday after the World Cup final but have seamlessly integrated into the squad in Durban and actively participated in practice sessions ahead of the first T20I.

The fight began after Gambhir allegedly called the veteran fast bowler ""fixer"" during their LLC game on Wednesday in Surat. It later extended to social media where Sreesanth wrote a lengthy Instagram post in reply to a cryptic post from Gambhir. However, when Harbhajan Singh, who led Manipal Tigers to a title win on Saturdat in Surat, was asked about his take on the incident, he channelised his inner Shah Rukh Khan to deliver an epic response.
""Bade baad shehro mein chhoti chhoti baatein hoti rehti hain(in big cities, small things keep happening),"" Harbhajan said in a presser during the tournament's final leg.
However, the legendary spinner was soon left disappointed when the infamous 'slapgate' incident, involving him and Sreesanth in the inaugural season of IPL was dragged in the following query by a reporter.
""That is an incident of the past. Let's not bring that up. What happened then was not right, and I don't have any hesitation in saying that the fault was mine. I don't know what happened this time (between Sreesanth and Gambhir). LLC has offered good cricket this year, and it would be better to stick to that only,"" he said.
The incident between Gambhir and Sreesanth happened during their LLC game on Wednesday with an ugly scene unfolding in front of the crowd before the on-field umpires were forced to intervene. Sreesanth later went live on Instagram to reveal that Gambhir was allegedly disrespectful towards him and used ""bad words"". The former India opener later put out a cryptic post which was followed by an angry response from Sreesanth: He wrote: “You have exceeded the boundaries of a sportsman and a brother, and above all, you represent the people. Yet, you continue to engage in conflicts with every cricketer. What is the matter with you? All I did was smile and observe, and you labeled me a fixer? Seriously? Are you above the Supreme Court? You have no authority to speak in such a manner and say whatever you please.""
On Friday, LLC organisers addressed the issue, saying that they will conduct an ""internal investigation"" and any proof of ""misconduct"" would be ""dealt with strictly"".

Runners-up in the 2023 edition of the ICC World Cup, the Dravid-coached Indian side will meet South Africa for a two-Test series as part of their World Test Championship (WTC) campaign.
A day before announcing India's squad, the BCCI offered Dravid an extension as the head coach of the men's senior team. Dravid had replaced former head coach Ravi Shastri in 2021. Under Dravid's watch, Rohit Sharma’s Team India made it to the semi-final of the T20 World Cup last year. India also retained the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home before meeting Australia in the final of WTC earlier this year. The Dravid-coached side also contested the final of the 2023 World Cup with eventual winners Australia at home.

However, Dravid confirmed that he had discussions about his tenure with the apex cricket board of India. The batting legend asserted that he will sign the contract once he gets the papers from the BCCI. According to a report filed by news agency PTI, it has been learned that the BCCI is yet to finalise Dravid's contract although an extension is given to the former India skipper.
""We have given the extension but we are yet to finalise the contract. We did not get time at all, they finished (with the World Cup).

If the disappointing defeat taught India anything is the need for a back-up for Hardik Pandya, who continues to recover from the injury he incurred in October during the World Cup, and the management failed to address the issue during the Australia series. But Suryakumar Yadav, who has been retained as the captain for the second-straight T20I contest, this time against South Africa, revealed that India have their plans in order for a sixth-bowling option.
Despite the learnings from the World Cup final loss, Suryakumar did not turn towards a sixth bowler through the course of the five T20Is India played against Australia. In fact, a medium-pace-bowling all-rounder in Shivam Dube was unutilised in the contest before being dropped for the three-match T20I series against South Africa that begins from Sunday onwards in Durban. But even in the playing XI, India had part-time options on Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Varma- but the captain was content with the primary options at his disposal.
Speaking the media on Saturday in the pre-match presser, Suryakumar revealed that in the contest against South Africa, which stands as India's penultimate stop before the T20 World Cup in June, the matter will be attended to.
""We do have a sixth-bowling option,"" Suryakumar said. ""There are lots of people to bowl. When the time is right, you will see. Not just six, there could be seven or eight too.""
India have only six T20I matches in hand, a three-match Afghanistan contest being next, to decide on their T20 World Cup squad. But Suryakumar admitted that India aren't too perturbed over the it, adding that the IPL 2024 season precedes the World Cup which will also give the selectors time to take their call.
""I feel there are limited T20s going forward, before the T20 World Cup, but then we play 14 league games in the IPL as well,"" Suryakumar said. ""And players who have been playing in these T20 internationals... they've played a lot of games, and they have a lot of experience under their belt. So, we don't think there will be an issue or any problem in selecting the squad because everyone knows their roles really well and responsibilities really well - [like] how to play in different situations.""

Moving on from another ICC heartbreak, India have touched down in the rainbow nation for a multi-format series against hosts South Africa.
Entering the T20 World Cup year without seasoned campaigners Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah, India are also without its skipper Rohit Sharma for the white-ball leg of the South Africa tour.

Out of the last 19 T20Is at the venue, the team batting first has emerged victorious in eight and the chasing side has sealed the same number of wins. Two games have been washed out while India and Pakistan famously played a drawn game at Kingsmead back in the 2007 T20 World Cup. Speaking at the pre-match press conference, skipper Suryakumar made it clear that India 'have the combination in mind'.
The 32-year-old also stated that India have 'enough sixth bowler options in this side to bank upon'. In the previous encounter, India rested Ishan Kishan, who is expected to feature and keep wickets against South Africa on Sunday. Either Ruturaj Gaikwad or Yashasvi Jaiswal will be making way for all-format opener Shubman Gill.

High on confidence from a triumphant performance against Australia, where they dominated with a convincing 4-1 victory in the five-match T20I series at home, India arrive in South Africa exuding confidence. Suryakumar Yadav, entrusted with the captaincy against Australia following Hardik Pandya's injury during the ODI World Cup in October, continues to lead the charge against the Proteas.
The imminent series against South Africa marks the return of Shubman Gill, Kuldeep Yadav, and Ravindra Jadeja to the squad as well. The three players, strategically rested after a grueling ODI World Cup campaign, now bring their well-honed skills back into the fold. The squad, however, continues to see the absences of batting stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who have been away from T20I action since the World Cup last year.
While Rohit Sharma was widely speculated to make a return in T20Is against South Africa, it was reported that Virat Kohli's selection in the shortest format will primarily depend on his performances in the 2024 edition of the Indian Premier League.
As India continue their preparation for the T20 World Cup, South Africa will be led by Aiden Markram and see a number of youngsters coming into the side in the shortest format. The hosts will aim at stopping the high-flying men in blue, who are currently the top-ranked side in the ICC T20I rankings.
However, as both teams prepare for the opening clash at Kingsmead, rain might put a dampener on the show; overcast weather is expected throughout the day on Sunday in Durban.
As per the Accuweather app, certain regions in Durban are anticipated to experience a morning thunderstorm, with persistently cloudy conditions forecasted throughout the day. Additionally, evening showers are predicted for the night. With the 1st T20I scheduled to commence at 4 PM SA time, there is a notable likelihood of rain potentially causing interruptions before, and during the match.

Despite losing the second T20I a day earlier after being dismissed for 80 runs, Harmanpreet Kaur and Co held their nerves while batting to avoid conceding a series sweep. England won the series 2-1.
Opting to bat, England were bowled out for 126 off the last ball of the innings after a half-century by skipper Heather Knight. In reply, India rode on a run-a-ball 48 by opener Smriti Mandhana to complete the chase in 19 overs.
India lost the wicket of Shafali Verma early in the chase, with the batter shuffling too far and playing a nothing shot to be bowled by Freya Kemp. Smriti and Jemimah Rodrigues (29 off 33 balls) got together to add a match-winning partnership of 57 runs for the second wicket. Both batters did especially well to hit 19 runs off the first two overs of Sophie Ecclestone, England’s most accomplished bowler.
India got two more important partnerships as Smriti added 26 runs with Deepti Sharma and then 18 with Harmanpreet. The India captain had twisted her ankle while fielding and came into bat at No.5, one spot lower than usual.
England fought back as Smriti and Richa Ghosh fell in quick succession, but young Amanjot Kaur, who had replaced Pooja Vastrakar in India’s line-up, walked to the crease with supreme confidence and hit Ecclestone for three fours in the 19th over to close out the match.
Earlier, it was the bowlers who stepped up on a batting-friendly pitch to set up the win for India. They looked rusty in the first game but displayed character to pick six wickets while defending just 80 runs in the second. This time, they made further progress by delivering as a unit.
In terms of fielding too, the hosts showed marked improvement. They seemed to be all over the place in the opener but took all the six catches that came their way this time, with Jemimah, Shreyanka Patil Amanjot leading the way.
Once again, it was Renuka Singh who did the early damage. Making a comeback to competitive cricket after nine months, on the back of a forgettable WPL campaign and a long injury layoff, the 27-year-old took two wickets in the powerplay for the third time in the series.
Shreyanka and Saika Ishaque were the most successful bowlers on the night. Both spinners had made their T20I debuts with the first game of the series and did exceedingly well to return figures of 3/19 and 3/22 respectively. Medium-pacer Amanjot chipped in with an important spell of 2/25.
England had made wholesale changes to their playing XI, bringing in Maia Bouchier, Danielle Gibson, Bess Heath and Mahika Gaur for Sarah Glenn, Natalie Sciver-Brunt, Danielle Wyatt and Lauren Bell. And the young line-up was under the pump for most of the innings.
After Alice Capsey was dismissed cheaply again, England got a 41-run partnership thanks to Heather and keeper-batter Amy Jones. But what followed was a dramatic collapse as India bagged five wickets for nine runs. At 76/8 in the 15th over, there was a sense of déjà vu and it seemed England would suffer the fate India did the previous night.
However, Heather led from the front thereafter to take her team to a respectable total. The 32-year-old, who had scores of 6 and 7* in the first two games, was batting on 20 off 25 balls at one stage. But she showed her class eventually and hit three fours and as many sixes to finish with a 42-ball 52. Her 50-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Charlie Dean (16*) gave England some much-needed momentum, but it didn’t prove to be enough in the end.
Brief scores: England 126 (Heather Knight 52, Renuka Singh 2/23, Shaika Ishaque 3/22, Shreyanka Patil 3/19); India 130/5 in 19 overs (Smriti Mandhana 48, Jemimah Rodrigues 29, Freya Kemp 2/24, Sophie Ecclestone 2/43). India won by 5 wickets

CRICKET,India's 1st T20I vs SA called off; Men In Blue left with 5 games before WC,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/india-first-t20i-against-sa-called-off-due-to-rain-men-in-blue-left-with-5-games-before-t20-world-cup-2024-101702226829896.html,"India's desire to start the process of finding an ideal combination for the T20 World Cup 2024 suffered a minor dent as their first match against South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled after persistent rain here on Sunday.
In fact, even the toss did not take place. Now, the 'Men in Blue' are left with just five T20Is – two more against the Proteas and three games against Afghanistan at home in January – ahead of next year’s showpiece in the West Indies and the USA.
In that context, India would have liked to make a head start to their search for a perfect blend at Kingsmead but rain put paid to those hopes temporarily. With the IPL 2024 preceding the T20 World Cup, the Indian think-tank will certainly bank on the league to identify the ideal 15 for the marquee event.
India stand-in captain Suryakumar suggested as much. ""I feel there are limited T20s going forward, before the T20 World Cup. But then we play 14 league games in the IPL as well,” Suryakumar had mentioned during his pre-match press meet on Saturday.
But then nothing really can supplant the confidence a player can accrue while performing well in international matches, and the weight of a good outing doubles if the touring destination is South Africa. It also offers the management a more realistic yardstick about a player’s ability.
The first-time visitors to the 'Rainbow Nation' such as Rinku Singh, Jitesh Sharma, Arshdeep Singh etc would have been eager to get that unique taste of cricket here and now they would have to wait till Tuesday for the second match at St George's Park at Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth.
From a leadership perspective, Suryakumar has done a very fine job while stepping in for injured Hardik Pandya during the home T20I series against the Aussies. Suryakumar led from the front in India’s 4-1 series victory.
The 33-year-old would have liked to make a winning start here against the Proteas to underline his credentials to give the bigwigs another name potentially to consider for the captain’s role, if it ever comes to that.
It wasn’t entirely amusing then to hear the Mumbai man talking about his comfort while shepherding a young side.
""From personal point of view, it (captaincy) is a big responsibility. I really enjoyed it in the last series (against Australia). I would love to do the same (winning the series) in the coming series in South Africa.
""But from a larger perspective, we’ll see what comes ahead but for now let’s focus on the series,"" he had said on Saturday.
The Durban T20I could also have handed India a chance to test their options for the sixth bowler slot, something that assumes importance as Pandya’s fitness continues to be iffy.
They, perhaps, could have tried the part-time spin of Tilak Varma, who recently bowled a few overs for Hyderabad in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.
Suryakumar did not provide a definite answer to the sixth bowling conundrum, but said they have enough personnel in their ranks to fill in that role. ""It is not like we don’t have a sixth bowling option. When the right time comes, you will see the sixth bowler or maybe the seventh or eighth (bowler),"" he had said. But for now, India will have to hit the meeting room and reinforce their plans ahead of the second match.

CRICKET,India need to identify more match-winners: Mithali Raj,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/india-need-to-identify-more-match-winners-mithali-raj-101702226261918.html,"The financial uplift in player salaries is there for all to see. There are now many players in Indian women’s cricket who can live a good life just by playing in the Women’s Premier League (WPL). But the qualitative difference may take time to have its impact in India’s T20 cricket – the format of the present and future.
Big-hitting prowess wins over everything else in the shortest format. Last year’s WPL saw overseas batters dominating proceedings while most of India’s batters strived for the right scoring tempo. This despite the advantage Indian players had in terms of playing opportunities – seven home players in the playing 11.
The leading run-scorer for all the five teams was an overseas batter. Only two Indians featured in the top 10 run-scorers' list. Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur who made the list were no WPL finds. Among the top 10 six-hitters, apart from Verma, Kiran Navgire, Dayalan Hemlatha and Richa Ghosh made the list; but none were able to make a match-winning impact.
Part of the reason is the absence of middle-order ball strikers in the Indian circuit – a problem that extends to the national team. Lack of lower-order depth cost India the 2022 Commonwealth Games Gold as well as this year’s T20 World Cup semi-final against Australia. Can WPL help change that?
“It will take time,” said Mithali Raj, mentor with Gujarat Giants. “Unless you have more players in domestic cricket playing at those slots which give the franchises an opportunity to identify them, it won’t happen. Right now, you pretty much have top orders of good state sides being picked at the auction.”
Australian players are by far the leaders in women’s cricket. A lot of the advance in Australia’s T20 cricket has come from Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) that began in 2015. Indian representation is limited to the big names, a reflection of the distance the rest of the players need to cover.
“WBBL has been around for a while and it has helped the Australia set up where a lot of players have come through the ranks,” said Raj. “But we have also seen that WPL in the first season itself gave players like Saika Ishaque, Shreyanka Patil, Kanika Ahuja. You have identified such players. By the second season you will have a stronger second string.”
The T20I series against England has showed up many cracks. Inability of players outside the experienced core group to leave an impact may be a matter of concern ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup. “It’s about how you prep in the run up to the World Cup. The tournament is in Bangladesh in similar conditions, which may be a blessing. But do we have players who can be match winners?” Raj asked.
“Right now, we have Smriti, Harmanpreet, Shafali and Jemimah. But what about the rest? We will have to identify more match winners who can step up when required.”

CRICKET,"BCCI Secretary Jay Shah confirms WPL 2024 to be held in ""one state""",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/bcci-secretary-jay-shah-confirms-wpl-2024-to-be-held-in-one-state-101702224698706.html,"New Delhi [India], December 10 (ANI): The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Jay Shah confirmed that the second season of the Women's Premier League will be played in ""one state"" of India.
After the WPL auction on Saturday in Mumbai, Shah spoke to reporters and talked about February as the possible month for the WPL, while also stating that the tournament will be held in one state.
""It is decided that we will have the tournament in February. Most probably, we will start in the second or third week. As far as the venue is concerned, it will be held in one state only so that it is better logistically. Logistics are very important for us this time; next time we can figure it [having more venues] out,"" Shah told reporters, as quoted from ESPNcricinfo.
The last edition of the WPL was held in Mumbai across two venues: the Brabourne Stadium and the DY Patil Sports Academy.
But this time, the three possible locations that have emerged for conducting WPL are Bangalore, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.
""We can do it either in Bangalore (Karnataka) or Uttar Pradesh. We have so many venues, even in Gujarat, where we have Ahmedabad and Rajkot and after a few years, Baroda can build their own stadium. Basically, it is a joint call between the franchises and the BCCI. We will sit together and we will decide. We will let you know. It will be in one state, that is for sure,"" Shah added.
India's women's team is currently playing in Mumbai against the England women's team. In the coming days, they will square off against Australia in Mumbai.
When Shah was quizzed about a plan for India's women's team to play in other states or cities, he said, ""The domestic season is going on, so we will have to see - where the venue is available, we will have it. There are [other] matches happening in Gujarat, Chandigarh, Ranchi... it is not the case that we want to organise matches in Mumbai only."" (ANI)

CRICKET,WPL: Big buy Vrinda Dinesh wants to open with Alyssa Healy,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/wpl-big-buy-vrinda-dinesh-wants-to-open-with-alyssa-healy-101702219955986.html,"For a decade and a half, Indian Premier League has unfailingly pitchforked domestic talent from modest playgrounds and competitions into international limelight, offering them a huge payday at the annual auction and often a pathway to higher achievements.
The Women’s Premier League has just wrapped up only its second auction on Saturday, and going by how young domestic talent Vrinda Dinesh and Kashvee Gautam hogged the headlines with franchises splurging money after bidding battles, exciting times are ahead.
Karnataka’s Vrinda, 22, chose to approach auction day like any other. The Karnataka U-23 captain didn’t want to miss the team’s training session at Raipur. She was bowling in the nets when one teammate whispered “Vrinda for 1.3” to another. Vrinda overheard, took a deep breath, and bear hugs followed.
“The first person I called was my mom,” Vrinda said in a virtual interaction a day after being bought by UP Warriorz for ₹1.3 crore. “I didn’t video call her because I knew there would be tears. I heard a faint voice and knew they (family) were overwhelmed and very happy for me. I just want to make them proud.”
Vrinda “still doesn’t want the feeling to sink in”. With the state tournament on, the talented batter also does not want to think too much. She will probably have to battle her emotions through the matches.
Sink in it ultimately will. For Warriorz, she may get a chance to walk out to bat with multiple World Cup winner Alyssa Healy. Hailing from Bengaluru, Vrinda would have liked a Royal Challengers Bangalore contract. She has grown up aspiring to bat like Virat Kohli and Meg Lanning. Healy is her new favourite, Warriorz her new home. That’s the way the dice rolls in franchise cricket.
On Saturday, Healy spoke about starting a new legacy as Australia captain. It was around the same time that Vrinda’s life-changing moments were unfolding the Mumbai WPL auction room as paddles were furiously being held up, first involving RCB and then Warriorz and Gujarat Giants.
Vrinda had been called to attend trials by all the five teams thanks to her key role in Karnataka’s run to the final of the women’s one-day competition. Her 477 runs in 11 innings came at an average of 47.70. In T20 cricket, she is one of the cleanest top order strikers among the younger crop.
It wasn’t always like that. “I was more of a Test player,” she said. “When I met coach Kiran Uppoor, he worked with me on what to eat, how to train, trying to do the small things well. On staying motivated for training sessions every morning. His team did not shy away from throwing 100 balls at me.”
After two matches for her senior state side in 2018, Vrinda kept a count of how many matches she missed – 22. “When I came back, I scored two back-to-back hundreds. Those two years, I worked extremely hard.”
She was well supported by Karnataka captain Veda Krishnamurthy who told her that she would get a full run of matches. In WPL, she will be up against Krishnamurthy (GG) and her long-time academy teammate Shreyanka Patil (RCB). “Now that she’s my opponent, I would like to score a few runs off her,” she said.
Vrinda plays down talk of prize-tag pressure, speaking instead of her desire to win the World Cup one day. To get that far, Vrinda knows she must bridge the gap between domestic and international cricket. On days, with certain match-ups, WPL can be a notch under international cricket. On other days, it can be as challenging as cricket could be.
The first WPL season gave Indian cricket players who had made the step up from domestic level. There were also others who were discovered, but they weren’t quite there. With her experience with India A, Vrinda knows how much work she needs to put in to turn auction room buzz into success on the field.
For now, with the auction money, she wants to gift her parents “the car they always dreamt of”.

CRICKET,Smriti Mandhana feels RCB ticked all boxes in WPL 2024 auction,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/good-bowling-side-wins-you-competition-smriti-mandhana-feels-rcb-ticked-all-boxes-in-wpl-2024-auction-101702201777490.html,"Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) found the right balance with their well thought out acquisitions at the Women’s Premier League (WPL) 2024 Player Auction held in Mumbai on Saturday.
RCB’s seven bids to fill the vacant spots and form a bold squad for the upcoming season were the result of extensive planning and strategy by the proficient backroom staff — which includes head coach Luke Williams, assistant head coach and head of scouting Malolan Rangarajan — with some crucial tactical inputs from skipper Smriti Mandhana.
Mandhana expressed her delight over auction picks and said the planning for the auction began after the first season only and they were keen to focus more on experienced bowlers who have bowled in Indian conditions.
The team secured one of the country’s most experienced spinners and Khel Ratna awardee Ekta Bisht ( ₹60 lakh), who is first Indian woman to take a hat-trick in the T20 Internationals. They further added pace into their attack by picking England’s Kate Cross ( ₹30 lakh) and young Indian all-rounder Simran Bahadur ( ₹30 lakh).
As part of RCB’s commitment to provide a platform for local young talents, they picked a promising domestic all-rounder Shubha Satheesh ( ₹10 lakh) from Bengaluru before adding 2016 Women’s Asia Cup-winner S Meghana ( ₹30 lakh) into the squad. Australian spin all-rounders Georgia Wareham ( ₹40 lakh) and Sophie Molineux ( ₹30 lakh) were the other two foreign acquisitions of the franchise to complete a strong 18-member squad.
Talking about the auction and the selection of players, Rajesh V Menon, VP and Head of RCB, said: “There are no shortcuts to building a team. You make the foundation brick by brick every season. We had lots of learnings from last year, and our main objective was to take those learnings into the auction, plug those gaps, and build a squad that would give us outstanding balance and flexibility to play in any conditions”
RCB, known for its Play Bold philosophy, not only snatched players who are good with the ball, but also those who are skilful with the bat as well.
“Bowling is definitely very important in T20s and a good bowling side wins you competition and this year we were looking to strengthen our spin unit and also look for overseas pacers who can complement Renuka [Singh] well. We have Kate Cross now and I think she will complement Renuka well in the power play with both swinging the other way. And with Molineux and Wareham, the bowling looks very experienced. Plus we have the likes of Shreyanka [Patil] and also [Sophie] Devine and [Ellyse] Perry,” Mandhana said.
Further explaining RCB’s approach and strategy behind the auction, the assistant head coach and head of scouting, Malolan said: “One of the things RCB did really well is to have strong Indian domestic core in Smriti Mandhana, Richa Ghosh, Renuka Singh, Kanika Ahuja and Shreyanka Patil, who form potentially your top five starters in the playing eleven, we have of a very good Indian core. Now, you add to that Sophie Devine, Ellyse Perry and Heather Knight, you have one half of the puzzle already sorted. We had a very focused approach to our auction as to how we can better this team with the options available out there. Our focus was to get a well-balanced bowling unit which can perform under any conditions we may encounter.”
Retained Players: Smriti Mandhana, Asha Shobana, Disha Kasat, Ellyse Perry, Heather Knight, Indrani Roy, Kanika Ahuja, Renuka Singh, Richa Ghosh, Shreyanka Patil, Sophie Devine.
New Buys: Georgia Wareham ( ₹40 lakh), Kate Cross ( ₹30 lakh), Ekta Bisht ( ₹60 lakh), Shubha Satheesh ( ₹10 lakh), S Meghana ( ₹30 lakh), Simran Bahadur ( ₹30 lakh), Sophie Molineux ( ₹30 lakh)

CRICKET,Pakistan team in Australia without a doctor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/pakistan-team-in-australia-without-a-doctor-101702182447015.html,"Sohail Saleem, who was named as the official team doctor for the series in Australia and New Zealand, is yet to join the team.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board is still trying to get a visa for Dr Saleem and as soon as it comes he will join the side in Australia in time for the first Test in Perth,” a reliable source in the PCB said.
He said similarly former Test batsman, Shoaib Muhammad, who was named manager of the Pakistan junior side taking part in the Asia Cup in UAE, has also been unable to leave with the squad.
""Shoaib had some expired passport issues which the board is sorting out and hopefully he will also soon reach UAE to take charge,” the source said.
Ironically even the off-spinner, Sajid Khan, who is set to replace Abrar Ahmed in the Pakistan squad in Australia has also had his departure delayed due to visa issues.

CRICKET,Demon Slayer Season 4: Short trailer for upcoming Hashira Training arc released | Watch,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/anime/demon-slayer-season-4-short-trailer-for-upcoming-hashira-training-arc-released-watch-101702218627644.html,"Demon Slayer has etched its name as one of the most popular anime series of all time. Shortly after the end of its third season, the production house didn't waste much time announcing Season 4. They even teased fans with a short teaser but it wasn't enough for fans awaiting the Hashira Training arc. The upcoming season is set to premiere with an hour-long episode next year. Ahead of its release, Ufotable has finally unveiled a short trailer, giving fans a glimpse into what's next for the all-new chapter.

Ufotable released an all-new trailer for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Season 4 on Sunday, December 10. The 4-minute-long trailer features spectacular animation including fan-favourite Tanjiro. The 2024 promotional reel was released only hours ago on Aniplex USA's official YouTube channel. So far the trailer has garnered over 56K views.
After a few scenes, the trailer cuts to the message, “A new chapter begins” with the iconic cast in the backdrop. It also introduces the new arc with individual characters including- Tengen Uzui, Shinobu Kocho, Muichiro Tokito, Mitsuri Kanroji, Obanai Iguro, Sanemi Shinazugawa, Gyomei Himejima, and Giyu Tomioka.
Although no official date for Demon Slayer Season 4 has been announced yet, it is expected to come out sometime in the Spring of 2024. Following the trailer release, fans were left excited about the upcoming season. One commented, “This is it guys, where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc, get yourself ready for what's coming next.”
Another fan wrote, “This season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all.” One more fan said, “Once this arc is over, now the real fun starts with some of the most epic fights/best story developments you've seen! (So excited for this to come along with the rest)”

CRICKET,India need to identify more match-winners: Mithali Raj,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/india-need-to-identify-more-match-winners-mithali-raj-101702226261918.html,"The financial uplift in player salaries is there for all to see. There are now many players in Indian women’s cricket who can live a good life just by playing in the Women’s Premier League (WPL). But the qualitative difference may take time to have its impact in India’s T20 cricket – the format of the present and future.
Big-hitting prowess wins over everything else in the shortest format. Last year’s WPL saw overseas batters dominating proceedings while most of India’s batters strived for the right scoring tempo. This despite the advantage Indian players had in terms of playing opportunities – seven home players in the playing 11.
The leading run-scorer for all the five teams was an overseas batter. Only two Indians featured in the top 10 run-scorers' list. Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur who made the list were no WPL finds. Among the top 10 six-hitters, apart from Verma, Kiran Navgire, Dayalan Hemlatha and Richa Ghosh made the list; but none were able to make a match-winning impact.
Part of the reason is the absence of middle-order ball strikers in the Indian circuit – a problem that extends to the national team. Lack of lower-order depth cost India the 2022 Commonwealth Games Gold as well as this year’s T20 World Cup semi-final against Australia. Can WPL help change that?
“It will take time,” said Mithali Raj, mentor with Gujarat Giants. “Unless you have more players in domestic cricket playing at those slots which give the franchises an opportunity to identify them, it won’t happen. Right now, you pretty much have top orders of good state sides being picked at the auction.”
Australian players are by far the leaders in women’s cricket. A lot of the advance in Australia’s T20 cricket has come from Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) that began in 2015. Indian representation is limited to the big names, a reflection of the distance the rest of the players need to cover.
“WBBL has been around for a while and it has helped the Australia set up where a lot of players have come through the ranks,” said Raj. “But we have also seen that WPL in the first season itself gave players like Saika Ishaque, Shreyanka Patil, Kanika Ahuja. You have identified such players. By the second season you will have a stronger second string.”
The T20I series against England has showed up many cracks. Inability of players outside the experienced core group to leave an impact may be a matter of concern ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup. “It’s about how you prep in the run up to the World Cup. The tournament is in Bangladesh in similar conditions, which may be a blessing. But do we have players who can be match winners?” Raj asked.
“Right now, we have Smriti, Harmanpreet, Shafali and Jemimah. But what about the rest? We will have to identify more match winners who can step up when required.”

CRICKET,₹353 crore cash seized from IT raids on Odisha liquor firm,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-353-crore-cash-seized-from-it-raids-on-odisha-liquor-firm-101702223499886.html,"The income tax raids on an Odisha-based distillery group across three states has netted ₹353 crore of cash in five days, the highest ever cash seizure in the history of income tax raids in the country, officials said on Sunday.
By Sunday evening, officials of three branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Bolangir, Titlagarh and Sambalpur managed to count all the seized cash, deploying over 3 dozen counting machines and 80 officials. While ₹48.5 crore was counted in Sambalpur and Titlagarh branch of SBI, in Bolangir Main Branch of the bank at least 50 employees managed to count ₹305 crore using 25 counting machines as IT officials pushed them to finish the operation by midnight.
“There were 176 bags of currency in the denomination of ₹100, 200 and 500 that was brought to the SBI Main Branch in Bolangir two days ago from the liquor company’s office in Sudapada locality of Bolangir town. Battling fatigue and machine breakdown, the staff have been busy counting throughout the day and night barring toilet breaks. The amount of cash the staff have counted in last 3 days is much more than what they would have done in a year,” said Bhagat Behera, regional manager of SBI Bolangir.
SBI officials said the counting process was hit by frequent machine breakdowns as they were not equipped to operate non-stop. “We had to keep 40 machines on stand-by as machines stopped working. Many of the currency notes stuck to each other due to mildew deposits and so we had to use dryers to separate the notes,” said an official, adding that there was no duplicate or ₹2,000 currency notes.
While the counting went on in the banks, the IT officials carried out further raids on country liquor breweries of Bunty Sahu and Rajesh Sahu who are close to the family members of Baldeo Sahu & Group of Companies that owns and operates a distillery plant in Odisha apart from several microbreweries. IT officials said they are interrogating Bunty Sahu and Rajesh Sahu to find out why so much cash was kept in Bolangir’s Sudapada area.
IT officials are also trying to find out the involvement of state excise officials as during the raids they found a polythene packet containing ₹5 lakh in currency notes with the name ‘Inspector Tiwari’ mentioned on the packet. “We think the person may either be from the exercise department or local police. We would interrogate officials from the excise department,” said an IT official.
Meanwhile, a special 20-member IT analysis team from Hyderabad joined the investigation to scan through the computer hard disk and other electronic items recovered during the raid.
Baldeo Sahu & Group of Companies which is a group company of Boudh Distilleries Private Limited, is linked to the Congress Rajya Sabha MP. His son Ritesh Sahu is the managing director, while elder brother Uday Shanker Prasad is the chairman of the company that manufactures extra neutral alcohol — a primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages. The former has other businesses, including Baldeo Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd (which makes fly ash bricks), Kwality Bottlers Pvt Ltd (an IMFL bottling unit), and Kishore Prasad Bijay Prasad Beverages Pvt Ltd engaged in the sale and marketing of different IMFL brands.
Meanwhile, politics over the record cash seizure hotted up with the BJP in Jharkhand staging protests at all district headquarters of the state demanding intervention of central probe agencies. “Corruption is in the DNA of the Congress. Congress leaders are engaged in the competition of corruption. The Congress must have kept this money for horse trading and resort politics after declaration of recently held elections results in three states,” said MLA C.P Singh demanding arrest of Congress MP Sahu.
State BJP spokesperson Shahdeo echoed the same. “ED and CBI should also come forward in this whole matter and MP Dheeraj Sahu should be strictly interrogated. When just one Congress MP has cash worth billions, then imagine how many trillions the entire party must have embezzled,” he said.
The demonstration was organised a day after state finance minister and Lohardaga MLA, Rameshwar Oraon, and JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya had taken strong exception to the BJP stand of politicising the issue of cash recovery from Sahu’s various locations in Jharkhand and Odisha before the official statement from the income tax department. They had termed IT’s action a ‘routine exercise’ and had asked the BJP to ‘practice patience’ in the matter.
Reacting to the BJP’s allegations, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee executive president and state co-ordination committee member Bandhu Tirkey said the opposition was resorting to ‘petty politics’.
“The BJP has no right to guide income tax on what to do or not to do in the matter at the time when the IT department is in action. Dheeraj Sahu and his ancestors are well known for their association with business. Before any official statement from IT, it is not right from the part of the party and its state president Babulal Marandi to point fingers at the chief minister and regard it as a matter of corruption. The BJP, who could do nothing to people like Nirav Modi, has no right to raise alarm in such matters. This is nothing more than petty politics,” said Tirkey.

CRICKET,Palestine supporters call for Zara boycott after its latest campaign - Here's why,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/palestine-supporters-call-for-zara-boycott-after-its-latest-campaign-heres-why-101702213444991.html,"Spanish clothing retailer Zara finds itself entangled in a crisis after the release of its latest ad campaign, titled ""The Jacket."" The campaign, intended to highlight the versatility of the garment, has sparked public outrage due to controversial images reminiscent of the Gaza genocide.
Zara asserts that the campaign's focus is on design, but the images depicted triggered strong backlash. Social media erupted with condemnation as users expressed their anger and disgust, vowing to boycott the brand. One user's statement echoed the sentiments of many: ""My jaw dropped seeing this. Boycott for life. You are disgusting demons. I can't believe what I'm looking at.""


The images in question include unsettling portrayals resembling Islamic burial attire and an upside-down map of Palestine, drawing stark parallels to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Critics accused Zara of exploiting tragic events for marketing purposes. A user commented, ""Do you think that 20,000 people are killed, and it is normal for you to use their deaths as a marketing method? Don't come out and say you didn't mean to... disgusting.""
Despite the public outcry, Zara has yet to issue a response or statement regarding the controversy. This is not the first time Zara has faced condemnation related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. In October 2022, Palestinians initiated a boycott campaign after Zara's franchise holder in Israel expressed support for the extremist Jewish Forces party.

Zara's branches in occupied territories reportedly suffered significant financial losses due to the boycott, estimated at tens of millions of shekels within a short period. The recent controversy intensifies the scrutiny on Zara's stance on sensitive geopolitical matters and raises questions about the intersection of fashion, politics, and ethical considerations. As consumers call for accountability, the fashion giant navigates a challenging terrain where social responsibility and brand image hang in the balance.

EDUCATION,Demon Slayer Season 4: Short trailer for upcoming Hashira Training arc released | Watch,https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/anime/demon-slayer-season-4-short-trailer-for-upcoming-hashira-training-arc-released-watch-101702218627644.html,"Demon Slayer has etched its name as one of the most popular anime series of all time. Shortly after the end of its third season, the production house didn't waste much time announcing Season 4. They even teased fans with a short teaser but it wasn't enough for fans awaiting the Hashira Training arc. The upcoming season is set to premiere with an hour-long episode next year. Ahead of its release, Ufotable has finally unveiled a short trailer, giving fans a glimpse into what's next for the all-new chapter.

Ufotable released an all-new trailer for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Season 4 on Sunday, December 10. The 4-minute-long trailer features spectacular animation including fan-favourite Tanjiro. The 2024 promotional reel was released only hours ago on Aniplex USA's official YouTube channel. So far the trailer has garnered over 56K views.
After a few scenes, the trailer cuts to the message, “A new chapter begins” with the iconic cast in the backdrop. It also introduces the new arc with individual characters including- Tengen Uzui, Shinobu Kocho, Muichiro Tokito, Mitsuri Kanroji, Obanai Iguro, Sanemi Shinazugawa, Gyomei Himejima, and Giyu Tomioka.
Although no official date for Demon Slayer Season 4 has been announced yet, it is expected to come out sometime in the Spring of 2024. Following the trailer release, fans were left excited about the upcoming season. One commented, “This is it guys, where only 1 arc away from the best and most awaited arc, get yourself ready for what's coming next.”
Another fan wrote, “This season will most likely be the least anticipated as its short but it contains the biggest clifhanger leading towards the best seasons of all.” One more fan said, “Once this arc is over, now the real fun starts with some of the most epic fights/best story developments you've seen! (So excited for this to come along with the rest)”

EDUCATION,India need to identify more match-winners: Mithali Raj,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/india-need-to-identify-more-match-winners-mithali-raj-101702226261918.html,"The financial uplift in player salaries is there for all to see. There are now many players in Indian women’s cricket who can live a good life just by playing in the Women’s Premier League (WPL). But the qualitative difference may take time to have its impact in India’s T20 cricket – the format of the present and future.
Big-hitting prowess wins over everything else in the shortest format. Last year’s WPL saw overseas batters dominating proceedings while most of India’s batters strived for the right scoring tempo. This despite the advantage Indian players had in terms of playing opportunities – seven home players in the playing 11.
The leading run-scorer for all the five teams was an overseas batter. Only two Indians featured in the top 10 run-scorers' list. Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur who made the list were no WPL finds. Among the top 10 six-hitters, apart from Verma, Kiran Navgire, Dayalan Hemlatha and Richa Ghosh made the list; but none were able to make a match-winning impact.
Part of the reason is the absence of middle-order ball strikers in the Indian circuit – a problem that extends to the national team. Lack of lower-order depth cost India the 2022 Commonwealth Games Gold as well as this year’s T20 World Cup semi-final against Australia. Can WPL help change that?
“It will take time,” said Mithali Raj, mentor with Gujarat Giants. “Unless you have more players in domestic cricket playing at those slots which give the franchises an opportunity to identify them, it won’t happen. Right now, you pretty much have top orders of good state sides being picked at the auction.”
Australian players are by far the leaders in women’s cricket. A lot of the advance in Australia’s T20 cricket has come from Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) that began in 2015. Indian representation is limited to the big names, a reflection of the distance the rest of the players need to cover.
“WBBL has been around for a while and it has helped the Australia set up where a lot of players have come through the ranks,” said Raj. “But we have also seen that WPL in the first season itself gave players like Saika Ishaque, Shreyanka Patil, Kanika Ahuja. You have identified such players. By the second season you will have a stronger second string.”
The T20I series against England has showed up many cracks. Inability of players outside the experienced core group to leave an impact may be a matter of concern ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup. “It’s about how you prep in the run up to the World Cup. The tournament is in Bangladesh in similar conditions, which may be a blessing. But do we have players who can be match winners?” Raj asked.
“Right now, we have Smriti, Harmanpreet, Shafali and Jemimah. But what about the rest? We will have to identify more match winners who can step up when required.”

EDUCATION,₹353 crore cash seized from IT raids on Odisha liquor firm,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-353-crore-cash-seized-from-it-raids-on-odisha-liquor-firm-101702223499886.html,"The income tax raids on an Odisha-based distillery group across three states has netted ₹353 crore of cash in five days, the highest ever cash seizure in the history of income tax raids in the country, officials said on Sunday.
By Sunday evening, officials of three branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Bolangir, Titlagarh and Sambalpur managed to count all the seized cash, deploying over 3 dozen counting machines and 80 officials. While ₹48.5 crore was counted in Sambalpur and Titlagarh branch of SBI, in Bolangir Main Branch of the bank at least 50 employees managed to count ₹305 crore using 25 counting machines as IT officials pushed them to finish the operation by midnight.
“There were 176 bags of currency in the denomination of ₹100, 200 and 500 that was brought to the SBI Main Branch in Bolangir two days ago from the liquor company’s office in Sudapada locality of Bolangir town. Battling fatigue and machine breakdown, the staff have been busy counting throughout the day and night barring toilet breaks. The amount of cash the staff have counted in last 3 days is much more than what they would have done in a year,” said Bhagat Behera, regional manager of SBI Bolangir.
SBI officials said the counting process was hit by frequent machine breakdowns as they were not equipped to operate non-stop. “We had to keep 40 machines on stand-by as machines stopped working. Many of the currency notes stuck to each other due to mildew deposits and so we had to use dryers to separate the notes,” said an official, adding that there was no duplicate or ₹2,000 currency notes.
While the counting went on in the banks, the IT officials carried out further raids on country liquor breweries of Bunty Sahu and Rajesh Sahu who are close to the family members of Baldeo Sahu & Group of Companies that owns and operates a distillery plant in Odisha apart from several microbreweries. IT officials said they are interrogating Bunty Sahu and Rajesh Sahu to find out why so much cash was kept in Bolangir’s Sudapada area.
IT officials are also trying to find out the involvement of state excise officials as during the raids they found a polythene packet containing ₹5 lakh in currency notes with the name ‘Inspector Tiwari’ mentioned on the packet. “We think the person may either be from the exercise department or local police. We would interrogate officials from the excise department,” said an IT official.
Meanwhile, a special 20-member IT analysis team from Hyderabad joined the investigation to scan through the computer hard disk and other electronic items recovered during the raid.
Baldeo Sahu & Group of Companies which is a group company of Boudh Distilleries Private Limited, is linked to the Congress Rajya Sabha MP. His son Ritesh Sahu is the managing director, while elder brother Uday Shanker Prasad is the chairman of the company that manufactures extra neutral alcohol — a primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages. The former has other businesses, including Baldeo Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd (which makes fly ash bricks), Kwality Bottlers Pvt Ltd (an IMFL bottling unit), and Kishore Prasad Bijay Prasad Beverages Pvt Ltd engaged in the sale and marketing of different IMFL brands.
Meanwhile, politics over the record cash seizure hotted up with the BJP in Jharkhand staging protests at all district headquarters of the state demanding intervention of central probe agencies. “Corruption is in the DNA of the Congress. Congress leaders are engaged in the competition of corruption. The Congress must have kept this money for horse trading and resort politics after declaration of recently held elections results in three states,” said MLA C.P Singh demanding arrest of Congress MP Sahu.
State BJP spokesperson Shahdeo echoed the same. “ED and CBI should also come forward in this whole matter and MP Dheeraj Sahu should be strictly interrogated. When just one Congress MP has cash worth billions, then imagine how many trillions the entire party must have embezzled,” he said.
The demonstration was organised a day after state finance minister and Lohardaga MLA, Rameshwar Oraon, and JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya had taken strong exception to the BJP stand of politicising the issue of cash recovery from Sahu’s various locations in Jharkhand and Odisha before the official statement from the income tax department. They had termed IT’s action a ‘routine exercise’ and had asked the BJP to ‘practice patience’ in the matter.
Reacting to the BJP’s allegations, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee executive president and state co-ordination committee member Bandhu Tirkey said the opposition was resorting to ‘petty politics’.
“The BJP has no right to guide income tax on what to do or not to do in the matter at the time when the IT department is in action. Dheeraj Sahu and his ancestors are well known for their association with business. Before any official statement from IT, it is not right from the part of the party and its state president Babulal Marandi to point fingers at the chief minister and regard it as a matter of corruption. The BJP, who could do nothing to people like Nirav Modi, has no right to raise alarm in such matters. This is nothing more than petty politics,” said Tirkey.

EDUCATION,Palestine supporters call for Zara boycott after its latest campaign - Here's why,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/palestine-supporters-call-for-zara-boycott-after-its-latest-campaign-heres-why-101702213444991.html,"Spanish clothing retailer Zara finds itself entangled in a crisis after the release of its latest ad campaign, titled ""The Jacket."" The campaign, intended to highlight the versatility of the garment, has sparked public outrage due to controversial images reminiscent of the Gaza genocide.
Zara asserts that the campaign's focus is on design, but the images depicted triggered strong backlash. Social media erupted with condemnation as users expressed their anger and disgust, vowing to boycott the brand. One user's statement echoed the sentiments of many: ""My jaw dropped seeing this. Boycott for life. You are disgusting demons. I can't believe what I'm looking at.""


The images in question include unsettling portrayals resembling Islamic burial attire and an upside-down map of Palestine, drawing stark parallels to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Critics accused Zara of exploiting tragic events for marketing purposes. A user commented, ""Do you think that 20,000 people are killed, and it is normal for you to use their deaths as a marketing method? Don't come out and say you didn't mean to... disgusting.""
Despite the public outcry, Zara has yet to issue a response or statement regarding the controversy. This is not the first time Zara has faced condemnation related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. In October 2022, Palestinians initiated a boycott campaign after Zara's franchise holder in Israel expressed support for the extremist Jewish Forces party.

Zara's branches in occupied territories reportedly suffered significant financial losses due to the boycott, estimated at tens of millions of shekels within a short period. The recent controversy intensifies the scrutiny on Zara's stance on sensitive geopolitical matters and raises questions about the intersection of fashion, politics, and ethical considerations. As consumers call for accountability, the fashion giant navigates a challenging terrain where social responsibility and brand image hang in the balance.

The incident shocked locals who confessed to have never seen anything like it.
Videos of the incident were shared on X(formerly Twitter). According to PTI, the fish were mainly sardines and some mackerel. As a result of the bewildering event, the beach was covered in a silver blanket, stretching for about a kilometre in length. Some locals began collecting and selling the fish. Officials then issued a warning to people to not consume the fish.

According to a report by AP, Takashi Fujioka, a Hakodate Fisheries Research Institute researcher, weighed in on the probable causes behind the incident. Fujioka said the fish may have been chased by a large predator due to which they got exhausted amid a lack of oxygen and eventually got washed ashore.
On the matter of consuming the fish, Fujioka said: “We don’t know for sure under what circumstances these fish were washed up, so I do not recommend” eating them.
Meanwhile, conspiracy theories are also being discussed on social media. Some netizens have linked it to the release of treated wastewater from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant. Japan's decision to discharge the wastewater in October angered its neighbours including China. China imposed a ban on all seafood imports from Japan. Later, Russia also put restrictions on the import of fish and seafood from the island nation.
However, Japan backed its move of releasing the treated radioactive water as ""safe"".

Trump, a leading figure in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, voiced concerns about the four criminal investigations against him, characterizing them as politically motivated attempts to hinder his potential return in the 2024 Election. With 91 counts, including 44 federal charges, Trump emphasized the gravity of these legal challenges.
Addressing Biden directly, Trump stated, ""He's opened up a Pandora's box that will never let our country be the same. I can only say to Joe: Be very careful what you wish for, but what you have done is a terrible thing.""
Trump asserted that the indictments he faces are ""Biden indictments against their political opponent,"" portraying them as unconventional and politically driven. Amid potential impeachment proceedings against Biden over allegations related to his son Hunter's foreign business deals, Trump warned, ""I am being indicted for you.""
There are concerns that Trump's return to the White House could lead to authoritarian tendencies, with fears of seeking revenge on political adversaries. Trump responded to questions about potential abuse of power, stating, ""I want to be a dictator for one day,"" emphasizing his desire for border security and expanded oil drilling.

In a notable reference to recent media coverage, Trump clarified, ""I didn't say that I want to be a dictator. I said I want to be a dictator for one day because I want a wall and I want to drill, drill, drill.""
This warning is not the first of its kind. Trump has previously expressed concerns about potential repercussions for Biden and his administration, highlighting a shift in political campaigns. As Trump positions himself for the 2024 Election, his speeches continue to echo warnings and challenges that could reshape the political landscape.

WORLD NEWS,‘Cannot pressure us to end war’: Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu on Gaza truce,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelhamas-war-cannot-pressure-us-to-end-war-israels-benjamin-netanyahu-on-gaza-truce-101702201237313.html,"Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuffed international calls to end the Gaza war calling them inconsistent with supporting the war-aim of eliminating Hamas. Briefing his cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu said he had told the leaders of France, Germany and other countries, ""You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas"".
This comes as fighting raged in the Gaza Strip in the third month of war between Israel and Hamas. Hamas from the Gaza Strip attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militant group took around 240 hostages -- 137 of whom remain in Gaza, officials have said. In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, launching a military offensive in Gaza that has killed at least 17,700 people, mostly women and children.
During a seven-day truce that expired on December 1, Hamas released 105 hostages including dozens of Israelis who were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Mediator Qatar said that efforts to secure a new truce and release more hostages were ongoing. The Qatar PM warned that the relentless Israeli bombardment was ""narrowing the window"" for a successful outcome.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization chief said that it will be all but impossible to improve the ""catastrophic"" health situation in Gaza. The emergency action, proposed by Afghanistan, Qatar, Yemen and Morocco, seeks passage into Gaza for medical personnel and supplies.
""I must be frank with you: these tasks are almost impossible in the current circumstances,"" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

Israel invaded Gaza in retaliation for Hamas attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people. Israel's assault on Gaza has killed at least 17,000 people, Gaza health authorities say.
The United States on Friday vetoed a proposed U.N. Security Council demand for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas.

""We strongly condemned the terrorist attack against Israel on Oct. 7,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Al Jazeera in an interview aired on Sunday at the Doha Forum conference.
""At the same time, we do not believe it is acceptable to use this event for the collective punishment of the millions of Palestinian people with indiscriminate shelling.""
Lavrov said that for there to be ""humanitarian pauses"" in Gaza ""some kind of monitoring on the ground"" was needed.
""We addressed the [UN] Secretary General [Antonio Guterres] suggesting that he use his authority to consider some kind of monitoring - but so far to no avail,"" Lavrov said.
President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly accused the United States and the West of ignoring the need for an independent Palestinian state within 1967 borders. Putin on Sunday spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Gaza.
""This happened not in a vacuum,"" Lavrov said, pointing to decades of blockade and unfulfilled promises about a Palestinian state.
The UN's Guterres has previously said that the Hamas attack did not happen in a vacuum. Israel said Guterres had justified the Hamas attacks with such words. Guterres rejected the Israeli accusations.
Asked in the Al Jazeera interview if Russia was being hypocritical with its criticism about that fate of the Palestinians while Russia fights a war in Ukraine, Lavrov said neither he nor Russia were hypocritical.
Lavrov said that the West was trying to exhaust Russia in Ukraine by supplying weapons and that if peace talks were to take place then Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would have to annul his own presidential decree.
""It is up to the Ukrainians to recognise how deep they are in the hole where the Americans put them,"" Lavrov said when asked if the war was at a stalemate.
When asked by Al Jazeera what the chances were of diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire or peace in Ukraine, he said: ""You'll have to call Mr Zelenskiy because a year and half ago he signed a decree prohibiting any negotiations with Putin.""
Lavrov said that a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia was almost reached in Istanbul in March and April 2022 based on the idea of Ukrainian neutrality.
""This deal was aborted - it was cancelled because the Americans and the Brits decided that if Putin is ready to sign it then lets exhaust him more. That's what they are doing now. Stalemate or no stalemate - that is the fact,"" Lavrov said.
Asked in the interview about the August plane crash which killed Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, Lavrov said investigators had probed the crash.
""As regards the soldiers from Wagner group... quite a number of them went to Belarus and started to serve there,"" Lavrov said ""Others joined the regular structures of the Russian army - and they continue to serve.""

France's Armies Ministry said the drones “came straight at” the Languedoc two hours apart from the direction of Yemen. The warship destroyed them both about 110 kilometers (70 miles) off the Red Sea port of Al Hudaydah on the Yemeni coast, it said.
The statement did not say what weaponry the Languedoc used to bring down the drones. The frigate is on a French Navy mission in the Red Sea.

Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a televised broadcast, as per news agency AFP, “Neither the fascist enemy and its arrogant leadership... nor its supporters... can take their prisoners alive without an exchange and negotiation and meeting the demands of the resistance.”
A one-week truce in the war that collapsed on December 1 saw 105 hostages held by the group freed, including 80 Israelis. They were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Israel said 137 captives remained in the Palestinian territory while mediator Qatar said that efforts to secure a new truce and release more hostages were ongoing but warned that the relentless Israeli bombardment was ""narrowing the window"" for a successful outcome.
Abu Obeida said Hamas would continue to fight Israeli forces.
""We have no choice but to fight this barbaric occupier in every neighbourhood, street and alley,"" he said, adding, ""The enemy's holocaust aims to break the strength of our resistance... but we are fighting on our land in a holy battle.""
The war in Gaza was triggered after Hamas carried out a brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. In Israel's retaliatory air, land and sea assault against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, at least 17,700 people, most of them also civilians, have been killed.

WORLD NEWS,"Liz Magill resigns: ‘One down, two to go’ – What's next for Harvard president?",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/liz-magill-resigns-one-down-two-to-go-whats-next-for-harvard-president-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-101702224644592.html,"The University of Pennsylvania President, Liz Magill, made headlines with her voluntary resignation amid intense scrutiny over her recent testimony on antisemitism. Scott Bok, chair of Penn’s board of trustees, announced her departure, specifying that Magill will remain in her role until an interim leader is appointed.
In a statement shared by Bok, Magill expressed gratitude for her time as president, stating, ""It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution,"" highlighting her collaboration with various stakeholders to advance Penn’s vital missions.
Magill, along with Harvard President Claudine Gay and MIT President Sally Kornbluth, testified before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on antisemitism issues. The examination revolved around their responses to incidents on college campuses during the Israel-Hamas war.
Colleges reported a surge in antisemitic incidents amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, leading to a contentious atmosphere. The focus of the inquiry, particularly on Magill, Gay, and Kornbluth, was their handling of calls for the genocide of Jews and whether it violated their institutions’ code of conduct against bullying and harassment.
Despite persistent questioning from Rep. Elise Stefanik, the university leaders provided carefully worded responses. Magill, pressed on the issue, acknowledged, ""If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.""
Magill faced criticism not only for her testimony but also for allowing a Palestinian literary festival on Penn's campus, leading to accusations of antisemitism against some speakers.
Stefanik deemed their answers ""unacceptable and antisemitic,"" urging the university presidents to resign. After Magill's resignation, Stefanik shared on X, ""One down. Two to go."" House Committee Chair Virginia Foxx announced a formal investigation, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro criticized Magill's testimony.
Magill responded to the backlash through a video message on X, acknowledging her oversight and emphasizing the evil nature of calls for genocide. She called for the clarification and evaluation of the school's policies.
The fate of Harvard President Claudine Gay and MIT President Sally Kornbluth remains uncertain. Lawmakers have called for their resignations as well, and pressure is mounting on college campuses. Gay clarified Harvard's stance against calls for violence, emphasizing accountability for those threatening Jewish students. Kornbluth, while not directly addressing her testimony, urged standing against hate.
Magill's resignation prompted mixed reactions on social media. While some celebrated her departure, others decried what they perceived as the alleged censorship of pro-Palestinian voices on college campuses.

Scott Bok, citing Magill's resignation, noted external attacks and portrayed Magill as a victim of relentless pressure. He acknowledged her misstep in providing a legalistic answer to a moral question during the congressional hearing.
The fallout from Magill's resignation goes beyond an individual university, reflecting broader debates on free speech, antisemitism, and pro-Palestinian expression on college campuses. It prompts a reconsideration of how universities navigate these complex issues while upholding principles of free speech and ensuring a safe environment for all students.

Javier Milei warned there was no alternative to a fiscal ""shock"" in his maiden speech after being sworn into office on Sunday, saying his predecessors had left the country without funds and on a path to hyperinflation.
The outsider libertarian, a former TV pundit, has ridden a wave of voter anger at triple-digit inflation, tumbling foreign currency reserves and rising poverty amid the South American country's worst economic crisis in over two decades.

The fourth GOP primary debate was held on Wednesday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and was hosted by NewsNation.

The former President also took shots at his other rivals and slammed the poll numbers of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
""To begin with, I thought Ron DeSanctimonious was terrible, with his bobblehead facial movements and his walking on eggs, but that Sloppy Chris Christie was worse. He's not fit, mentally or physically, to be President plus, he suffers from TDS, or Trump Derangement Syndrome, at levels not seen before,"" Trump stated further calling the former New Jersey governor a ""sick puppy""
He further stated that the campaign of former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson -- who did not qualify for the debate earlier this week -- was ""dead"".
""But so is Ron, whose weird bobbing head and fresh mouth, make his high heels look good -- He's walking on eggs! Birdbrain looked different and lost, but I give her second place,"" he quipped, referring to Nikki Haley.
""Vivek WINS because he thinks I'm great,"" Trump added.
Notably, amid intense campaigning, both Trump and Ramaswamy have been praising each other and have appeared to be less critical of each other's policies.
Ramaswamy had dubbed Trump ""the best president of the 21st century"" during last week's Republican primary debate and has characterized his candidacy as a bid to take the former president's policies ""to the next level.""
Even Trump had signalled that he would be open to having him as his running mate, stating that ""He would be very good..."".
However, despite the former president's praise, Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny over his performance in the debate earlier this week, in which he called Haley a ""fascist"" and claimed Christie's ""version of foreign policy experience was closing a bridge from New Jersey to New York,"" The Hill reported.
Republican strategist Scott Jennings said that most people do not like the ""below-the-belt punches"". He noted that while Ramaswamy may have tried to act in the style of Trump, it did not work for him.
The Indian-American leader grabbed widespread attention and became one of the most-searched 2024 Republican contenders after the debate at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum.
But, the latest national Fox News poll showed Ramaswamy polling in fourth place at 7 per cent, maintaining the same amount of support he had in October. Ahead of him are former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley at 11 per cent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 14 per cent while Trump carries a huge lead of a whopping 62 per cent.
The next US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.

WORLD NEWS,Kate Middleton's carol theme could still unrest in Meghan and Harry: Here's why,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kate-middletons-carol-theme-could-still-unrest-in-meghan-and-harry-heres-why-101702215581031.html,"As the holiday season approaches, Kate Middleton's annual Christmas carol concert, ""Together at Christmas,"" is stirring up anticipation. However, this year's theme, focused on creating ""supportive, nurturing worlds around children and adults,"" is predicted to raise eyebrows, particularly from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Scheduled for December 8, 2023, at Westminster Abbey, the festive event, featuring performers like Adam Lambert, Beverley Knight, and others, has evolved into an annual celebration of community service. The theme for this year's carol service aligns with Kate's dedication to early childhood development, emphasizing the importance of supportive environments for children and adults.
The chosen theme, though well-intentioned, might not sit well with Harry and Meghan, given their past claims about lack of support during Meghan's pregnancy. Jack Royston, host of The Royal Report podcast, pointed out that the theme could enrage the Sussexes, as it contrasts with their narrative that Meghan wasn't adequately supported during her pregnancy. Royston highlighted statements from Meghan's lawyers, asserting that she was left unprotected while pregnant and faced intense trolling.
The theme also delves into Meghan's revelations to Oprah in March 2021 about experiencing suicidal thoughts during her pregnancy with Archie. The podcast host explained, ""Their whole case is that Meghan was not supported by the royals during the months when she was pregnant.""
While the royal family gathers for the annual Christmas concert, Harry and Meghan's holiday plans remain uncertain. Speculations range from spending the festive season in Montecito, California, to a potential reunion with British royals at Sandringham. However, recent controversies, such as the naming of ""royal racists"" in Omid Scobie's book, make the likelihood of a Sandringham reunion less certain.
As the carol concert approaches, royal watchers eagerly anticipate both the festive performances and the potential reactions from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

During the 50-minute call Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized what he termed “dangerous co-operation” between Russia and Iran. He also expressed displeasure with the positions put forward by Russian representatives at the UN and other forums against Israel.
“The prime minister emphasized that any country that would suffer an attack such as Israel experienced would act with no less force than the one with which Israel operates,” his office said.
""Any country that had been struck with a criminal terrorist assault such as Israel experienced would have reacted with no less force than Israel is using,"" he told Vladimir Putin.
Benjamin Netanyahu requested that Russia put pressure on the Red Cross to visit and provide medicine for the estimated 137 hostages still held by Hamas. No humanitarian organization has visited them since they were taken by the militant group. In Israel's retaliatory air, ground and sea assault targeting Hamas, at least 17,700 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip.
However, the Kremlin hasn’t released a readout of the conversation. This comes as Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel in the October 7 massacre, including babies, children and the elderly, and kidnapped about 240 back to Gaza. Some of those taken hostage have since been released in an exchange deal with Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.

The campaign, intended to highlight the versatility of the garment, has sparked public outrage due to controversial images reminiscent of the Gaza genocide.
Zara asserts that the campaign's focus is on design, but the images depicted triggered strong backlash. Social media erupted with condemnation as users expressed their anger and disgust, vowing to boycott the brand. One user's statement echoed the sentiments of many: ""My jaw dropped seeing this. Boycott for life. You are disgusting demons. I can't believe what I'm looking at.""


The images in question include unsettling portrayals resembling Islamic burial attire and an upside-down map of Palestine, drawing stark parallels to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Critics accused Zara of exploiting tragic events for marketing purposes. A user commented, ""Do you think that 20,000 people are killed, and it is normal for you to use their deaths as a marketing method? Don't come out and say you didn't mean to... disgusting.""
Despite the public outcry, Zara has yet to issue a response or statement regarding the controversy. This is not the first time Zara has faced condemnation related to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

""Tintin in the Congo"" by Belgian comic strip artist Herge, the second volume of ""The Adventures of Tintin"", was first published in 1931.
The Belgian Congo -- comprising most of present-day Republic of Congo -- was then a colony of the European country, becoming independent in 1960.
In the comic Tintin, an intrepid reporter, travels to Belgian Congo to report on events there leading to encounters with native people, wild animals and an American diamond-smuggling gangster.

Over recent decades, the comic strip has become increasingly controversial, with critics pointing to its racist and colonialist treatment of the local population.
The new edition, launched in November together with two other books in the Tintin series, carries a preface explaining the colonial context of the time.
It also contains tweaks to the story. At one point, Tintin teaches an African child mathematics, whereas in the original he teaches the child that its home nation is Belgium.
The cover was also changed from the original, showing Tintin facing off against a lion, whereas before he was sitting with a black child.
""This volume goes back to a time, that is thankfully over, where it was acceptable to consider blacks as inferior,"" said Patrick Lozes, founder of CRAN, a federation of anti-racism associations.
He welcomed the addition of the preface, which he said went ""in the right direction"".
The preface, written by Philippe Goddin -- head of the Friends of Herge association -- is mostly concerned with defending the record of Tintin's creator in terms of racism.
""He defended himself vigorously against that charge,"" he wrote. ""He happily mocked everybody, whites and blacks.""
In an interview with AFP Goddin said ""there is a thin line between caricature and racism, he did not cross that line"".
Pascal Blanchard, a historian of colonialist propaganda, said he was ""surprised"" that the publishers did not make a special announcement of the changes, and that the new preface was not mentioned on the cover.
He called the preface ""highly debatable"".
Claims that Herge's work had simply been a reflection of his time were ""facile and false"", he said.
Herge himself admitted in 1975 that all he knew about the Belgian Congo was ""what people talked about"" at the time, saying: ""I drew Africans in the pure spirit of paternalism that was prevalent back then.""
Herge is considered as one of the leading cartoonists of the 20th century, with a unique style that influenced many artists, including pop artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Tintin's adventures have been translated into 130 languages, sold 260 million copies and been made into TV shows and a Hollywood film.

Sunak proposed new legislation to help shield the Rwanda plan from legal challenge and that bill is due for an initial vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Sunak is spending the weekend trying to quell rebellions from both the right and center of his party that threaten to scupper the bill and erode his leadership.
“I am confident that when people look at the legislation and have a chance to reflect that they will recognize that this is a tough but also proportionate measure,” Gove said in an interview on Sky News on Sunday. The government had “no intention” of calling an early election in the face of opposition within the Tory ranks, he said.

Sunak, who had initially opposed the Rwanda plan before becoming premier, has now staked his future on the deportations as a critical piece of the effort to slash record migration into the country. Tory Rebels have threatened to vote against the legislation, saying it doesn’t go far enough to prevent migrants from launching legal challenges to deportation.
Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, a Sunak ally, resigned over the Rwanda plan on Wednesday when it was announced, exposing just how profound the rift in the party over immigration remains. Jenrick said in an interview with the BBC on Sunday the current legislation will not deliver the “serious deterrent” needed to dissuade people from entering the country illegally and would not prevent deportations from being tied up in the courts.
“I won’t support this bill, but I do feel like we can fix this,” Jenrick told the BBC.
Arrivals to the UK remain at record levels, despite repeated promises from Sunak and his Tory predecessors to curtail immigration. The government has already paid Rwanda £240 million ($301 million) so far, and no deportations have yet taken place because of legal challenges to the plan.
Sunak must call elections by January of 2025 and the Conservatives have been consistently trailing the opposition Labour party by 20 percentage points in opinion polls. Curtailing immigration is critical to the Tories having any chance in the election, Jenrick said.

WORLD NEWS,Nobel winner Mohammadi blasts 'tyrannical and anti-women religious' Iran regime,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-winner-mohammadi-blasts-tyrannical-and-anti-women-religious-iran-regime-101702209876746.html,"The Iranian people will ultimately overcome authoritarianism imposed by a government that has lost legitimacy and public support, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi said from prison in a speech read by her children on Sunday.
The Norwegian Nobel committee in October awarded the prize to Mohammadi, 51, for her non-violent fight ""against oppression of women in Iran"" and the promotion of human rights for all, in a rebuke to Tehran's theocratic leaders.
Her 17-year-old twins Kiana and Ali Rahmani collected the prize, a gold medal and diploma, at a ceremony in Oslo's City Hall attended by several hundred guests. The prize includes a cheque for 11 million Swedish crowns (about $1 million).
In her speech, sent from Iran's notorious Evin prison, Mohammadi said continued resistance and non-violence were the best strategies to bring about change.
""The Iranian people, with perseverance, will overcome repression and authoritarianism. Have no doubt, this is certain,"" she said in her speech read in French.
The women's rights advocate is serving multiple sentences on charges including spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic after her last arrest in November 2021.
""I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison,"" Mohammadi said, adding that her life and lives of many activists in Iran had been a constant struggle ""to stay alive"".
Mohammadi was symbolically represented on stage in Oslo by her portrait and an empty chair, highlighting that she is among only a handful of laureates to be prevented from attending the ceremony since the award's 1901 inception.
She was awarded the prize just over a year following 22-year-old Mahsa Amini's death in the custody of Iranian morality police after allegedly violating rules related to the hijab, an Islamic headscarf.
Amini's death unleashed years of pent-up anger among Iranians over issues ranging from economic misery and discrimination against ethnic minorities to stricter social and political controls.
Women, including schoolgirls, took off and burned hijabs, revolting against laws obliging women to cover their hair and wear loose-fitting clothes during nationwide protests that were put down with deadly force.
""We believe that the mandatory hijab imposed by the government is neither a religious obligation or a cultural tradition, but rather a means of maintaining control and submission throughout society,"" Mohammadi said.
Iran has called the protests Western-led subversion, accusing the Nobel committee of meddling and politicizing the issue of human rights.
The protest movement, which adopted the slogan - Woman, Life Freedom - has significantly contributed to the expansion of civil resistance in Iran, and went on despite severe government repression, Mohammadi said in her speech.
""The reality is that the Islamic Republic regime is at its lowest level of legitimacy and popular social support,"" she said.
""Now is the time for international civil society to support Iranian civil society, and I will exert all my efforts in this regard,"" Mohammadi added.
The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded annually on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.

The unidentified man, wearing a hat and mask and looking like a cowboy, was captured by surveillance cameras installed at the facility.
A CCTV video of the incident has gone viral on social media in which the man can be seen entering Sparkman Cellars in Woodinville. Surveillance footage then shows gallons of wine spilling on the floor after the man allegedly messed up with the tanks.

According to a report by the New York Post, the incident happened at around 7:34 p.m. on the night before Thanksgiving. The report says that the man used an employee keycode to gain access to the building.

It is the Ukrainian leader's first-ever trip to Latin America as Kyiv continues to court support among developing nations for its 21-month-old fight against Russia's invading forces.
A political outsider who has railed against what he calls entrenched official corruption in Argentina and promised to uproot the political establishment, Milei ran on a pro-Western foreign policy platform, repeatedly expressing distrust of Moscow and Beijing.
ALSO READ| Gaza health situation 'catastrophic', diseases could spread, WHO chief warns
Zelenskyy phoned Milei shortly after the Argentinian's electoral victory, thanking him for his “clear support for Ukraine” which he described in social media posts as “well-noticed and appreciated by Ukrainians”.
In its readout of the call published shortly later, Milei's office said he had offered to host a summit between Ukraine and Latin American states, a potential boon to Kyiv's monthslong effort to strengthen its relationships with countries of the global south.
Zelenskyy and other senior Ukrainian officials have repeatedly presented Ukraine's war against Russia as resistance against colonial aggression, hoping to win support from Asian, African and Latin American states that in the past struggled to free themselves from foreign domination, sometimes turning to Moscow for support against Western powers.
According to Zelenskyy's official website, he broke his journey to Argentina to meet with the prime minister of the West African country of Cape Verde, Ulisses Correia e Silva, thanking him for his support for Kyiv's diplomatic initiatives and discussing efforts to boost Ukrainian grain exports to Africa. It was not immediately clear where the meeting took place.
Zelenskyy expressed his appreciation for Cape Verde's backing of UN resolutions supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory before peace talks can begin.
The African country previously supported UN documents condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
According to Zelenskyy's website, he and Correia e Silva also discussed Kyiv's efforts to expand a corridor for grain exports in the Black Sea that has seen over 7 million metric tons of Ukrainian produce shipped out since its inception, months after Moscow pulled out of a UN-brokered deal to facilitate shipments of Ukrainian and Russian food and fertiliser to countries in need, as well as a proposal to establish transport and storage hubs for Ukrainian grain in Africa.

The UN health agency called a special session of the WHO executive board to discuss the health conditions in the Palestinian territories, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus describing a collapsing system with medics facing an ""impossible"" job.
""The impact of the conflict on health is catastrophic,"" Tedros said in his opening remarks to the meeting in Geneva.
""As more and more people move to a smaller and smaller area, overcrowding, combined with the lack of adequate food, water, shelter and sanitation, are creating the ideal conditions for disease to spread,"" he said.

Tedros said there were worrying signs of epidemic diseases and the risk was expected to worsen with the deteriorating situation and approaching winter conditions.
""Gaza's health system is on its knees and collapsing,"" Tedros said, with only 14 out of 36 hospitals functioning with any capacity at all, and of them, only two are in the north of the coastal territory.
Only 1,400 hospital beds out of an original 3,500 are still available, while the two major hospitals in southern Gaza are operating at three times their bed capacity, running out of supplies and sheltering thousands of displaced people, Tedros added.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas after the group's unprecedented attacks on October 7, when its fighters broke through Gaza's militarised border, killed about 1,200 people and seized hostages, according to Israeli officials.
The fighting has killed at least 17,700 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Tedros said that since October 7, the WHO had verified more than 449 attacks on healthcare in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and 60 attacks on healthcare in Israel. The WHO does not attribute blame for the recorded attacks.
""The work of the health workers is impossible and they are directly in the firing line,"" he said.
""In summary, health needs have increased dramatically and the capacity of the health system has been reduced to one third of what it was.
""WHO is on the ground in Gaza to support health workers who are physically and mentally exhausted, and are doing their best in unimaginable conditions.""
""There is no health without peace, and no peace without health,"" Tedros concluded.

WORLD NEWS,Deadly baby formula bacteria strikes again in US - What parents need to know,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/deadly-baby-formula-bacteria-strikes-again-in-us-what-parents-need-to-know-101702205601180.html,"Federal health officials have confirmed that the same bacteria responsible for the 2022 baby formula recall is back, causing devastating consequences. This year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disclosed two alarming cases related to Cronobacter sakazakii, linked to the consumption of powdered formula manufactured by Abbott Nutrition, the company involved in the previous recall.
Tragically, a newborn in Kentucky lost its life, while an infant in Missouri suffered brain damage due to life-threatening infections caused by this bacteria. The babies had consumed Abbott Nutrition's powdered formula, emphasizing the severity of the situation.
Notably, Abbott and the FDA found no evidence linking the contamination to the formula maker's facilities. Instead, investigations suggest that contamination likely occurred after the formula containers were opened at home, raising awareness about proper handling.
While Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in 2022 following the detection of Cronobacter sakazakii, the FDA clarified that the recent cases do not warrant new recalls. The infections were not traced back to manufacturing, and the FDA emphasized, ""There is no indication of a broader public health concern related to this product at this time.""
In a heartbreaking case in Missouri, a 6-week-old baby named Mira White faced severe brain infection from the bacteria found in an open container of Similac NeoSure formula. Mira's story underscores the devastating impact of this bacterial threat, leading to seizures and neurological damage.
Similarly, in Kentucky, a baby consuming Similac Total Comfort powdered formula lost its life after contracting Cronobacter sakazakii. This tragic incident emphasizes the urgent need for increased awareness and caution among parents.
Cronobacter sakazakii is a naturally occurring germ found in the environment, especially in dry foods like powdered infant formula. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses the importance of maintaining cleanliness to reduce the risk, advising parents to frequently clean surfaces, hands, and baby products. Additionally, parents are urged to avoid placing formula scoops on countertops, keep lids and scoops clean and dry, and promptly close formula containers after use.
As this bacterial threat resurfaces, parents are encouraged to stay informed and adhere to stringent hygiene practices when handling powdered infant formula, prioritizing the health and safety of their little ones.

Ongoing Israeli bombardment is ""narrowing the window"" for a successful outcome, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said at Doha forum.
""Our efforts as the state of Qatar along with our partners are continuing. We are not going to give up,"" he said, adding that ""the continuation of the bombardment is just narrowing this window for us"".
Qatar was a key mediator in negotiations that resulted in a seven-day truce under which scores of Israeli hostages were exchanged for Palestinians prisoners and humanitarian aid. The ceasefire ended at the start of the month.
""We are going to continue, we are committed to have hostages released, but we are also committed to stop the war,"" Qatar's prime minister said, continuing, ""We are not seeing the same willingness from both parties"".
Meanwhile, at the forum, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Security Council was ""paralysed by geostrategic divisions"" that were undermining solutions to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
UN's ""authority and credibility were severely undermined"" by its delayed response to the war, he said after a US veto prevented a resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire.
""I reiterated my appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared,"" he told the forum. Regrettably, the Security Council failed to do it. I can promise, I will not give up,"" he said.
“We are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system. The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region,” the UN chief said.

Sir Edward Young, on behalf of the Queen, emphasized the importance of their safety due to the Duke's public profile, military service, and history of targeting by extremists.
The documents reveal the Palace's insistence on security for the Sussexes, emphasizing the importance of safety for the family, citing the past tragic incidents and invoking the memory of Princess Diana.
ALSO READ| High Court backs Daily Mail's ‘honest opinion’, rules out Prince Harry in the libel lawsuit
The Palace recognized the independent processes for the provision of publicly funded security, involving the UK Government, the government of Canada, and other host governments.
Contradicting the narrative that the Sussexes were cut off by the Royal family after leaving Britain, the documents challenge Prince Harry's portrayal of the Palace's attitude toward his security situation. He had expressed distress and fear about life without UK personal protection officers, describing it as an ""obligation"" and ""implicit promise"" from the Palace. However, the decision regarding security does not fall to the Royal family but lies with the independent committee Ravec.
The Duke's discussions about security after leaving the Royal family, detailed in interviews and his autobiography, portrayed his desperation to retain security. The court case revolves around whether Prince Harry made a genuine offer to pay for his own security and if that message was communicated to decision-makers. The judge ruled that the Mail on Sunday may argue that Prince Harry's team misled the public about his offer to pay for security.
The late Queen's sentiment about the Sussexes was one of familial care, stating they would ""always be much-loved family members."" After moving to Canada, where they initially received publicly funded security, they eventually sought refuge with Tyler Perry in California, including security offered by him.

The case, set to go to trial, delves into the Duke's security discussions post-Royal family departure. Tensions between the Duke and Sir Edward Young have been noted, with Harry claiming Young's involvement in discussions was inappropriate due to personal tensions. However, representatives argue the relevance of personal tensions in the Duke's change in status when stepping back from royal duties.
The trial is anticipated to explore details surrounding the security arrangements and Prince Harry's alleged offer to fund his own security, shedding light on conflicting narratives between the Sussexes and the Royal family.

WORLD NEWS,Houston elects veteran Democrat John Whitmire as mayor,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/houston-elects-veteran-democrat-john-whitmire-as-mayor-101702190244574.html,"Houston has elected Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire as its new mayor, following a runoff election on Saturday night. Whitmire, a seasoned Texas lawmaker with 50 years of service representing the city, secured a victory over US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.
At 74 years old, Whitmire is one of the most influential Democratic legislators in Texas and is now poised to lead America’s fourth-largest city. His campaign was centered around key issues such as crime reduction, street improvements, and fostering unity among the people.
Whitmire’s campaign expenditures far exceeded those of Jackson Lee, who was vying to become Houston’s first Black female mayor.
The release of an unverified audio recording in October, which allegedly captured Jackson Lee profanely criticizing her staff, posed a challenge for her campaign. Despite this, Whitmire managed to establish a commanding lead among early voters, winning this demographic by a margin of 30 percentage points.

In his victory speech, delivered to a ballroom filled with enthusiastic supporters at the city’s convention center, Whitmire expressed, “I don’t mind telling folks what a great city we have. But we’ve got great challenges. If we will come together and realize it won’t be easy. In fact, we will face challenges. But I see that as an opportunity. And I need you to join hands with me. We’ll meet our challenges. It’ll be an opportunity to show the nation what the city of Houston can do.”
Jackson Lee graciously thanked her supporters at her election night party. She congratulated Whitmire on his win.
“It’s sweeter to be saying what a sweet victory it is. It’s equally as sweet to acknowledge we put up a good fight,” she said.
The journey to the runoff saw Whitmire and Jackson Lee emerge from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the general election held on November 7. Both candidates, who are prominent political figures in Houston, leveraged their extensive political experience as a testament to their qualifications for leading a city that is grappling with issues such as crime, deteriorating infrastructure, and potential budget deficits.
Whitmire’s political career began in the Texas Legislature in 1973, where he served as a state representative and later as a state senator for the majority of his tenure. Jackson Lee has been representing Houston in Congress since 1995 and previously served on Houston’s City Council.

Houston’s rapid growth over the past decade has brought both challenges and opportunities, transforming the area into a burgeoning stronghold for Texas Democrats. Although the mayoral race is officially nonpartisan, both Whitmire and Jackson Lee are Democrats.
As the oldest big city mayor in the US, Whitmire will lead a city that is increasingly youthful, with a median age of around 35 and a quarter of its population under 18, according to census data. The election of Whitmire, who is 74, and Jackson Lee, who is 73, sparked some frustration among younger Democratic voters who are eager for fresh political talent in Texas to challenge the GOP’s 30-year statewide dominance.

They reportedly shared a video showing an apparent Hamas operative handing over an assault rifle while surrendering with dozens of Palestinian men to Israeli troops, according to a report from Times of Israel.
“I see the achievements every day. We are seeing every day more and more terror operatives killed, more and more terror operatives wounded, and in recent days we’re seeing terrorists surrendering — a sign of the disintegration of the system, a sign that we need to push harder,” Times of Israel quoted IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi as saying.
The footage shows a man moving slowly near a tank, carrying the gun and magazine above his head before setting them down. Nearby, other Palestinians in their underwear display their ID cards while positioned across the street from the tank. A soldier issues instructions in Arabic using a megaphone.
“In Shejaiya and Jabaliya, terrorists who surrendered handed over weapons and equipment,” IDF official said confirming the leaked video.
On Saturday, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar fled northern Gaza at the beginning of the war by hiding in a humanitarian convoy heading southward, the Times of Israel report said citing Kan public broadcaster. The report further said Sinwar fled Gaza City and headed toward south Gaza’s Khan Younis in a vehicle that provided “humanitarian cover”. More precise details about the vehicle were barred from publication, according to the broadcaster. The report also said Israel assessed that Sinwar was still in Khan Younis, or rather in one of the tunnels that run underneath it.
The Times of Israel reported that IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed a significant number of Hamas members surrendered to troops in Gaza, revealing valuable intelligence information about the terror group's operations during the ground assault
“From the interrogations of the terrorists who surrendered, the following intelligence has emerged: The situation of the operatives on the ground is difficult, and the Hamas leadership, led by [Yahya] Sinwar, denies the reality even though it is updated on the details,” Hagari said.
“The operatives complain that the Hamas leadership is out of touch with the tough situation they are in on the ground,” he added.
Hagari said there was a “widespread feeling that the Hamas leadership underground does not care about the public in Gaza who are above ground,” adding that this also worries the Hamas operatives.
“The intelligence that emerges from the interrogations creates more targets and aids us in the operational activity,” Hagari added.
Meanwhile, members of the war cabinet met on Saturday night for talks on the continued fighting in Gaza, along with whether to again allow Palestinian workers into Israel after they were barred in wake of the Hamas-led October 7 onslaught in which terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took around 240 hostage.

SPORTS,Novak Djokovic has the mind of a beast hell-bent on attacking and winning,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/tennis/djokovic-has-the-mind-of-a-beast-hell-bent-on-attacking-and-winning-101700561423896.html,"Novak Djokovic is 36 years old. In a sport like tennis where physicality matters a lot, most athletes contemplate retirement at this age but the Serb is defying the norm and appears to be getting more and more ruthless by the day. He appears to be vindictive too. He may slip up once but very rarely will he slip up twice.
On Sunday at the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, home star Jannik Sinner would have hoped for a repeat of his group-stage success against Djokovic but Djoker’s fans would know he doesn’t fumble again. In a rather dismissing performance, he saw off Sinner in just 103 minutes for a straight-sets victory.
However, despite his superhuman performances over the years, Djokovic doesn’t enjoy the kind of following Roger Federer did during his playing days or even today. Rafael Nadal too appears to have the upper hand in that regard. It’s probably down to Djokovic’s tendency not to hold back in his media addresses. He doesn’t mince his words, calls a spade a spade which doesn’t make him a likeable character. Like earlier this month after winning the Paris Masters, he indirectly took a massive dig at Nadal. The Serbinator said he was going to break all possible records that he could break and he won’t pretend that he was not playing for records unlike some people. Frankly speaking, he is not only breaking records but is also extending them.
Djokovic means what he says. This year has been fabulous for him. He equalled (at the Australian Open with a record-extending 10th title) and surpassed Nadal’s record of maximum grand slam wins (at the French Open) in men’s tennis. And then with the win in the US Open, he extended his lead at 24 wins. He has finished the year as the world’s number one player, for a record-extending eighth time.
Nadal isn’t the only one who has faded a bit against Djokovic’s brilliance. Federer, who has won 20 grand slams, too has lost one of his big records to Djokovic. The Serb’s win against Sinner on Sunday brought him his seventh triumph at the ATP Finals. A record seventh title. Heading into the event, Djokovic and Federer were tied at six titles each. The Paris Masters win was also a record-extending seventh title for the Serb.
He is the only player in men’s tennis with three Career Grand Slams. The latest of the three came at the French Open earlier this year. He has also begun his 400th week as the world’s number one, another milestone unheard of and to be proud of.
Djokovic is a head-strong person. He doesn’t like to be part of the mob. When he refused to get vaccinated for Covid-19 and as a result he was barred from many tournaments, including the Australian Open last year, he didn’t break down. Millions of people died the world over and his stance didn’t sit well with many fans but Djokovic stuck to his guns. This particular incident shows what Djokovic is made of. It appears Djokovic for some time now is channelling his pent-up anger after being thrashed from fans and fellow players left, right and centre during the pandemic days.
Djokovic has made massive strides this year and left behind his biggest rivals Nadal and Federer. The Swiss has retired from the sport and the injury-troubled Spaniard has announced he is likely to call it quits next year. From the current crop, there are not many who can hold their own against Djokovic for long in a game so he is certain to be in the ascendancy for a few years more, subject to how long he can keep himself fit. As of now there is no end in sight for Djokovic. Be that as it may, it will be interesting to see if Djokovic will be able to keep up his ruthlessness once Nadal, the last of his arch-rivals, walks off into the sunset. Who else would he like to prove a point to? Djokovic has not won an Olympic gold as yet. The 2008 Bronze winner has often spoken of his ardent desire to tick that box. He hasn’t achieved a Grand Slam (to win all four titles in a calendar year) either - in fact nobody has achieved it in men’s tennis since Rod Laver in 1969 - and maybe these two unfulfilled desires will keep him going.

“Honestly, if you would have told me at the start of the year that I will have such results in the coming months, I wouldn't have believed. Having said that, in javelin an improvement of 3-4 metres is not unnatural. So, once I started doing well, I knew I could get in the 85-87m range.”
Having started the year with a best throw of 78.93m that helped him win the season-opening Indian Open Throws Competition, it turned into a largely subdued season for Jena as he managed to breach the 80m mark just once in his next four competitions.
“The turnaround happened in Sri Lanka in July where I threw 84.38m. I was under tremendous pressure going into that event as it was a make-or-break situation. Had I not done well there, I wouldn’t have made the cut for the Budapest Worlds and ultimately the Asian Games medal and Olympics qualification wouldn’t have happened. So for me, the Sri Lankan championships remains the most important performance of the year.”
While 2023 in Indian athletics will be remembered for Chopra’s historic world title and the men’s relay team finishing fifth at the World Championships in Budapest, Jena’s ascent does deserve mentioning. He entered the year with a personal best of 78.05m. In the 12 competitions he participated in 2023, he dipped under that mark only twice, bettering his best seven times in eight months. By the time the season ended, Jena had improved that start-of-the-year PB by 9.49m.
“People say it is a miracle, but in sports there are no miracles. This is the result of Jena’s unwavering dedication and commitment to get better,” his coach Samarjeet Singh Malhi says from Patiala. So much so that barring travel days, Jena missed training only for four days. “That was only because of the visa trouble ahead of the World Championships, otherwise he never missed a session. He didn’t go home, stuck to the diet and fitness routines and trained with single-minded zeal.”
Malhi took Jena under his wing towards the end of 2021 when the volleyball player-turned-javelin thrower had a PB of 76.41m. A jump of 11.13m in two years is the result of a meticulous process put in place that involved a gradual overhaul of Jena’s technique. He also stands at 1.73m, much shorter than Chopra (1.82m) and DP Manu (1.87m-PB 84.35m).
“From his run-up to block to angle of release, we changed everything over time. Credit goes to Jena for trusting the process. He submitted himself to me and the sport rewarded him,” the coach says. “I could sense he is a 85m-plus thrower because his foundation was always strong. At the start of the year, we earmarked Budapest and Hangzhou as our main targets and went about things in a clinical manner. Thankfully, everything came together.”
The test, Malhi says, will be to maintain the momentum. Jena’s success was built on peaking at the right time and Malhi believes the challenge will be to repeat it in 2024. “Of course, Olympics will be our primary goal next year. We now know that Jena can throw in the 87-88m range. In fact, I expected him to throw 88m in Hangzhou. If he manages to consistently throw in that range, he will be a genuine medal candidate in every big meet.”
India’s athletics season is likely to begin next month but the field events will start only in March. Jena is using the three months off-season to work on strength, endurance and technique. This involves using the 900gm javelin as opposed to the 800gm spear used in senior men’s competitions.
“Heavier javelin will improve his arm speed. We also want to improve his pace on the runway, so even a small improvement in speed (with a heavier javelin) will translate into a significant jump once he runs with the 800gm javelin. We are also working on his block to ensure his front knee doesn’t collapse while throwing,” the coach says.
For Jena, the trick lies in repeating what worked for him. “I don’t think we need to do something drastically different. I will just stick to the process and do my best. Who knows, on a good day, something special may happen.”

Man United must rebound from an embarrassing 3-0 loss Saturday at home to Bournemouth in the Premier League and needs to beat Bayern Munich, which already advanced a month ago.
Newcastle hosts AC Milan in a must-win meeting of two teams facing the same jeopardy in the competition's tightest group, where Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappé can yet deny them both.
Four places in the pre-quarters are left to fight for and the Premier League risks having just Manchester City and Arsenal in the draw on December 18.
That would be England's weakest challenge in the knockout draw for 11 years and at the worst possible time. Bonus extra entries in the revamped 36-team Champions League next season are given to the two countries whose teams have the best collective record across the three UEFA competitions this season.
Man United is last in the Group A standings, a point behind both Copenhagen and Galatasaray and must beat Bayern while hoping the other two play to a draw in Denmark.
Newcastle and seven-time champion Milan are tied on five points in Group F and only a win on Wednesday can lift either above PSG a couple of points ahead in second place.
PSG heads to group leader Borussia Dortmund knowing a point is enough to seal the head-to-head tiebreaker against Milan, but not against Newcastle. Dortmund already secured its pre-quarters place.
The other two pre-quarters places — worth an initial UEFA prize money payment of 9.6 million euros (USD 10.3 million) — will be decided in showdown games where teams in second place host a third-place opponent.
Napoli needs only a draw against Braga on Tuesday and would advance even with a loss by one goal because its overall group difference is better. Real Madrid already won that group before visiting Union Berlin.
A draw would suit Porto against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday because of beating the Ukrainian champion in the group opener in September. Barcelona leads the group and finishes at Royal Antwerp, the only team with five straight losses.
Though Inter Milan and Real Sociedad will be in the pre-quarters, they meet in Italy on Tuesday with the leadership of Group D at stake. A draw is enough for Sociedad to ensure being seeded in the pre-quarters draw as the group winner – and avoid facing City or Bayern next.
Atletico Madrid hosts Lazio on Wednesday with a similar scenario in play for Group E.
Group winners (seeded in the December 18 draw): Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Real Madrid.
Runners-up (unseeded): Leipzig, PSV Eindhoven.
Qualified, still competing to win group: Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Lazio, Real Sociedad.
In the pre-quarters, teams cannot play an opponent from their own country or a team they already faced in the group stage.
Third-place teams in Champions League groups keep playing in February in the knockout playoffs for the second-tier Europa League.
Feyenoord and Young Boys are assured of being in the Europa League playoffs, and either Porto or Shakhtar will join them. The picture is uncertain elsewhere.
The showdown games next week with third place at stake for teams eliminated from Champions League contention include Lens hosting Sevilla and Salzburg hosting Benfica. Newcastle vs Milan could end up in this category if PSG is winning at Dortmund.
Sevilla is the supreme Europa League team with a record seven titles, all in the past 20 years. The latest Europa title in May is why Sevilla got into the Champions League this season after a lowly 12th place in La Liga. Sevilla must win at Lens on Tuesday.
The Europa League knockout playoffs draw also be made on December 18. In it, Champions League third-place teams are unseeded playing home legs first against runners-up in the Europa League groups, which could include Roma, Brighton and Sporting Lisbon.
Winners advance to the pre-quarters joining Europa League group winners like Liverpool, Bayer Leverkusen and Atalanta.

SPORTS,Devin Haney remains undisputed boxing champ as he beats Regis Prograis,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/devin-haney-remains-undisputed-boxing-champ-as-he-beats-regis-prograis-101702217732009.html,"Devin Haney beat Regis Prograis by unanimous decision in his division debut to win the WBC super welterweight title in his hometown on Saturday night.
Haney (31-0) remained unbeaten with a slow but dominant victory over Prograis in front of a sellout crowd at Chase Center in San Francisco, home of the Golden State Warriors.
All three judges scored the bout 120-107 in Haney’s favor. Prograis (29-2) lost for the first time since October 2019.
“It’s a dream come true,” Haney said. “I knew I had him hurt a few times. I went in there and was real disciplined. I made it as easy as possible.”
It was Haney’s first fight as a super welterweight after dominating as the undisputed lightweight crown. Haney made the decision to move up after having trouble making weight at lightweight.
Now as a two-division champion, Haney is eyeing a third title.
“I want to talk to my dad and see what’s next,” Haney said. “I want to do a fight at 147 but there’s a lot of fights at 140.”
The San Francisco native was cheered wildly while repeatedly landing a stiff left hand and several hard right hooks that kept Prograis from finding a rhythm.
He dropped Prograis in the third round with a stinging straight right hand.
Prograis couldn’t avoid Haney’s crisp right hand to the head that repeatedly landed and opened a small cut on his nose in the sixth round.
Prograis, who was criticized following a lackluster win over Danielito Zorrilla in June, picked up the pace in the latter rounds but it wasn’t enough. Haney continued to pepper Prograis and staggered the former champ with three consecutive hard right hooks in the ninth.
“He doesn’t have power to where it hurts you but it’s quick power,” said Prograis, who landed only 38 punches according to CompuBox. “It was hard to get to him. He’s definitely better than I thought he was.”
Prograis said he plans to stay in the 140-pound division with eyes on winning the title a third time. He also talked about the possibility of doing MMA in the future.
The win opens the door for Haney to take part in big money fights now. Among those being rumored for his next fight are Gervonta Davis and Ryan Garcia.
“I want to make the biggest, best fights happen,” Haney said. “The biggest fights are the most money.”
In the co-main event, Liam Paro beat Montana Love by TKO in the sixth round to win the WBO Intercontinental super lightweight championship. Paro dropped Love twice earlier in the round with a left uppercut and a left to the head before the referee stopped the fight.
Also on the undercard, Japan’s Miyo Yoshida won the women’s IBF bantamweight title by unanimous decision over defending champion Ebanie Bridges. Former Olympic champion Andy Cruz, in his second professional fight, defeated Jovanni Straffon by TKO in the third round to win the IBF and vacant WBA Continental Latin American lightweight titles.

A significant injury to the league's top scorer would be a huge hit to City's bid to retain the title with the team winless in their last four league games. ""A bone stress reaction in his feet,"" Guardiola told Sky Sports ahead of Sunday's kick-off when asked why Haaland was not in the squad. ""After the last game against Aston Villa he was like this and so he cannot play.
Asked about the severity, Guardiola said: “I don't know. Week by week, day by day, we'll see what happens.” The 23-year-old has been struggling with a foot injury, withdrawing from the Norway squad during the recent international break to return to Manchester for treatment.
A stress reaction, which includes swelling and bruising in the bone, can progress to a more serious stress fracture. Haaland has 14 league goals so far this term and last season broke the record for goals in his debut campaign, scoring 36 in 35 appearances.

SPORTS,"Aston Villa beat Arsenal, Liverpool lead EPL and more misery for Man United",https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/aston-villa-beat-arsenal-lucky-liverpool-leads-epl-and-more-misery-for-manchester-united-101702200104897.html,"Unai Emery came back to haunt Arsenal as Aston Villa cut another English Premier League title challenger down to size.
A 1-0 win at Villa Park set a new club record of 15 straight home victories in the league and moved Emery's team to within two points of first-placed Liverpool.
How sweet it must have been for the Spanish coach to get the better of his former club after being fired by Arsenal in 2019. He had already rebuilt his reputation before taking over a Villa team that was in danger of being relegated last season.
But his work with the Midlands club could be his finest yet in a career that has seen him win four Europa League titles.
Third-placed Villa looks like a serious title contender after a recent run that includes wins against Manchester City and Tottenham.
“We are increasing mentality and believing how we can be stronger,"" Emery said.
“We want to be in the top eight teams, but a lot of teams want to be there. At the beginning there were seven top teams, but we will fight to be in there. While we are in we can be excited and motivated to get it.”
John McGinn scored the only goal after seven minutes and Villa held on to deny late-goal specialist Arsenal an equalizer that manager Mikel Arteta believed was the least his team deserved.
“I’m really proud of the way the team played in this stadium against this team,” Arteta said. ""We deserved to win the game, but you have to be better in the boxes and things have to go your way as well.
""I see many, many teams come here and I haven’t seen many do what we have done to them today. The result is not there but, certainly, the way we played it was there.”
Arsenal led the league at the start of the day and dropped to second and a point behind Liverpool.
Manager Jurgen Klopp was relieved after “lucky” Liverpool pulled off a comeback 2-1 win at Crystal Palace.
Klopp admitted his team was “horrendous” as it trailed 1-0 at Selhurst Park after Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty in the 57th.
The attitude and momentum flipped when Palace's Jordan Ayew was sent off in the 75th and a minute later Mo Salah's deflected shot levelled the score. Almost inevitably, Harvey Elliott struck from distance to seal victory in stoppage time.
“I'm a very happy manager in this moment, but I know we were lucky as well,” Klopp said. ""If you only win your really good games you have no chance to be really successful, that’s how it is, and obviously today was not a really good game from us.
“For 76 minutes it was a really bad performance.”
SALAH’S RECORD
Salah's latest landmark goal launched Liverpool’s revival at Selhurst Park.
The Egypt international reached 200 goals for Liverpool — the fifth man to the mark — and 150 in the Premier League, which moved him into the all-time top 10, tied with Michael Owen.
“The most important thing was that we won the game,” Salah said. “It’s a great feeling. I’m happy for the record and that we won the game.”
Erik ten Hag looked like he had the weight of the world on his mind after another setback for Manchester United against Bournemouth.
An abject performance by United at home saw it lose 3-0 and spark loud jeers from the Old Trafford crowd.
Goals by Dominic Solanke, Philip Billing and Marcos Senesi piled the misery on Ten Hag, a day after he was named the Premier League manager of November.
It was United's seventh defeat in the league and 11th defeat in all competitions. It was all the more perplexing just three days after United's mood-lifting defeat of Chelsea by 2-1. United missed a chance to go level on points with fourth-placed Manchester City.
""Of course (I'm) annoyed, disappointed, definitely. I expected something different,” Ten Hag said. ""I hoped before the game you can build on the performance and result from Chelsea, so it’s very disappointing.”
It didn't take long for Chris Wilder to get a reaction from Sheffield United after returning to the club as manager this week. Having suffered defeat to Liverpool in midweek, he led his team to a 1-0 win against Brentford in his second game in charge.
James McAtee scored the decisive goal in first-half stoppage time.
But Sheffield United remained at the bottom of the table after 19th-placed Burnley drew with Brighton 1-1.
The bottom two are level on eight points each.
Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper faced mounting speculation about his job after losing 5-0 at Fulham in the week. His team led at Wolves on Saturday through Harry Toffolo, but was denied a win by Matheus Cunha's strike. A 1-1 draw at least halted Forest's four-game losing run. (AP) ATK ATK

And that is precisely how Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan put it when asked about his run in 2023. It was the year when he made his first ATP doubles final in five years at the TATA Open Maharashtra before making three straight main draw appearances in a Grand Slam alongside partner Sriram Balaji as alternates. Two weeks after their dream run in Pune at the start of the year, the Indian duo, who were ninth on the list of alternates, emerged as winners in their tough opening tie against 2022 French Open finalists, Ivan Dodig of Croatia and Austin Krajicek at the Australian Open. It was Jeevan's first ever Grand Slam win since making his debut at the 2017 Wimbledon. The pair, named 'BalaJee' by the Indian tennis community, later appeared at Roland Garros and Wimbledon as well, ending Jeevan's four-year wait for a main draw match at these two events.
Speaking exclusively to Hindustan Times Digital, ahead of his third appearance at the Tennis Premier League, which will kick off at Pune's Balewadi Stadium from December 12 onwards, the 35-year-old spoke about the league and its impact on Indian tennis before touching upon the crucial aspects of his 2023 season. Jeevan also revealed his ""realistic"" goals for the next season where he will have a fresh partner in Arjun Kadhe. Here are excerpts...
I'm very excited to be a part of it again. It's been a lot of fun and Kunal (Thakur) and Mrunal (Jain), the founders, always do a good job.
Definitely. It gives a lot of opportunity to youngsters to witness some really good tennis under pressure and it also helps grow the sport and popularity of it in and around India.
I was happy with the way my season finished. I was able to finish inside the top 100 (in ATP doubles ranking), so I'm happy about that as well. And yes, I'm very excited to see what's going to happen with my career next year with the goals being quite similar, getting into Grand Slams and winning matches.
I think it's just being in the right spot at the right time, practicing and just hoping to get an opportunity to play. It was a very memorable experience in Tata Open because we were waiting and practicing a bunch and as soon as we got in, we made the most of the opportunities. And yes, it's a process. It's not easy to get into these Grand Slam main draw events, but sometimes fortune favours your way and you get a chance to sneak into a big event and it's always nice to win matches when you get chances like that.

A post shared by Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan (@jntennis)
Well, if you're within a certain number of spots out of which we were in all the Grand Slams, just three or four spots out, they give you accreditation so that you can come on site and you can practice and use the locker room and prepare. So there's no reason not to do that when you're very close to getting into the Grand Slam. And that's kind of how you prepare for most events. Of course, you're just not sure if you're in the draw when you're an alternate, but you still prepare and you hang around.
It's a lot of waiting because like you said, it could be very last minute where a team pulls out, but then you have to be present and be alert and wait for an opportunity if it does come. And if not, then utilise it as a practice week and continue from there for the next tournament.
Balaji and I, we've been very good friends for a long time, so I think that helps when you're waiting around in such big events. I think we had a really good run and did well to break into the top 100. We were a very good team last year as well.
No, I'll be playing with Arjun Kade next year. The thought behind this pairing is simply down to the schedule lined up. Arjun and I are definitely excited to play together. He's got a big serve and I've never really actually played with him on the circuit before. I think there is a good potential to start a partnership with Arjun
All these tournaments come with their own set of difficulties to overcome. But I think the format is quite fast and tricky in doubles, even on the tour. You could have a great win one day and might incur a poor loss the next day, but staying consistent and putting yourself in a position where you are close to getting results, that's all we can really do and practice as much as possible so that we are sharp enough to get good results when the opportunities present themselves. I think that's pretty much all that we can control as players.

A post shared by Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan (@jntennis)
I think it doesn't change a whole lot because we spend around 30 weeks anyway on the road. It's always nice to have tournaments at home, but I do believe that there's going to be 3-4 challenger events in India in February. Of course it's sad that we don't have a big event like the Tata Open on home soil, but there are enough events in India, especially the Challengers. I think we are all conditioned to train and give our best regardless of where the tournament is.
I think we'll be doing that again. Through the doubles dream project, there's a training camp being held in Bangalore. KSLTA has been nice enough to offer their grounds for all the top doubles players in India to practice together. I am quite excited about that. As soon as the Tennis Premier League is done, we would all be going to Bangalore and the top guys would be training together until a bit past Christmas, and then everyone would kind of move on to whichever tournaments they need to.
The primary aspect of the the project is that it helps us with getting a physio on board and when you spend 30 weeks on the road, your body takes a lot of wear and tear. These expenses add up and I'm pretty sure that it takes a burden off us to know that we have somebody with us like a physio to take care of our body. And I think Mr. Kishore Patil has helped out a lot and Rohan has kind of administered the role designation for people very well. It's really nice to see something like this for the doubles players in India, and I would really love to see the top singles guys also get some help like this because India has definitely been struggling with their singles performances. Apart from Sumit Nagal, I don't think there's a player right now playing at the Grand Slam level and I know India is capable of a lot better than that, but there's a whole lot of different things which need to fall into place in order to make that happen. It would be very nice to see funding and support like that for the singles players as well.
First is always to stay healthy. I want to play a full season without getting injured as much as possible. Second, I would want to finish the year inside the top 60 or 70, so that I'm consistently in the Grand Slams. And that is a very realistic goal, I would think, because finishing at 94 this year, it's great because I had started the year around 120. So the way I look at that, it would be very doable to try to finish the year a few spots ahead and be securely into the Grand Slams. And then once you're there, you never know what happens. So I would say a comfortable position inside the top 100 is what my goal would be for next season.

SPORTS,Massive Saudi coup is shocking but then what options did Jon Rahm have?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/massive-saudi-coup-is-shocking-but-then-what-options-did-jon-rahm-have-101702173108821.html,"There were signs that something big was going to happen. When Jon Rahm's name was missing from the Hero World Challenge field, released in October, the gossip mill sprang into real action. The tournament is hosted by Tiger Woods. There has to be a solid season if a top golfer is going to miss a Woods event. There was one spot left vacant but fans and experts
were sure as hell it would be filled by Woods himself as it later turned out. More fuel was added to the fire early last month when Rahm pulled out of Woods and Rory McIlroy's technology-infused league, the TGL. The league has since been postponed from January 2024 to 2025 owing to a construction mishap at the designated venue in Florida.
It was easy to put two and two together. The world number three pulling out of the TGL was a clear indication that he was off to the Saudi-bankrolled LIV Golf. Such news had been doing the rounds in the preceding months even though Rahm had continued to show his support for the PGA Tour.
The inevitable happened this Friday as Rahm confirmed he was going to join LIV Golf. Last year, after quite a few big players defected to LIV, Rahm stood by the American tour. He was approached by the Saudis but he turned down their dream offer. He said money was not important to him, building a legacy was, for which the Tour was the place to be.
He has indeed done an about-turn on his previous statements. On Friday, he bigged up the importance of money (he has reportedly made upwards of $500 million), the importance of being able to spend more time with his family because of the short and sweet nature of the rebel league, and the importance of being part of a league that was out there to make golf a global game, not just confined to America and Europe. Basically, he dissolved everything he stood for once and gulped it down.
The Spaniard's move is going to displease a lot of people but he can't be entirely blamed. After the formation of LIV Golf, PGA Tour had labelled them enemies and put up a united front with the DP World Tour. Rahm chose the side he believed in. Then earlier this year the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and LIV Golf shocked one and all by joining hands, leaving their animosity far behind. If fans and experts ought to blame anyone for Rahm's departure, it has to be the Tour and the merger they initiated in June. A lot of Tour players, including Rahm, felt betrayed by the American tour.
The Spaniard was willing to sacrifice. But if the people you stand up for compromise the cause of rendering the Saudi tour insignificant, what other choices does one have? This is a revenge move, to all intents and purposes. It's a slap in the face to the PGA Tour, the echo of which is going to be heard for a long time. If there are no principles and integrity left, it doesn't matter which side you are on. The hell is empty and all the devils are here.
World number two McIlroy, who spared no effort to humiliate LIV golfers in the past one year or so, is singing a different tune this time. He didn't want any LIV golfers to represent Team Europe in the Ryder Cup which was won by the hosts in Rome in September-October but now in the next edition which will be held in the US in 2025, he wants Rahm in the team despite the defection. 29-year-old Rahm remained undefeated in the four matches he played and in all earned three points at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club and played a massive hand in Europe's thumping 16.5-11.5 win.
One should not be surprised if more big names from the Tour join the Saudi league in the coming months. If the two-time major winner's move is any indication, be prepared for the PGA Tour to make allowances for LIV golfers in terms of their participation in Tour events.
This year a few players were able to play in the majors because of exemptions but the doors were entirely shut for them on other events on the American tour. The Saudis have reportedly pledged $1 billion and no way are they going to invest that much amount without gaining some influence and having certain things go their way. The three tours are expected to announce the full details of the merger by December 31.
When all is said and done, the intrigue is not over yet. The merger was not the end of it, it was rather the beginning. The golf world is well and truly in turmoil.

A midweek victory over Chelsea had offered cause for optimism but in-form Bournemouth exposed just how far Ten Hag's United have fallen behind this season.
The Dutchman looked forlorn as he watched on in the teaming Old Trafford rain as his shambolic side were comprehensively outplayed and fortunate not to lose by more.
They were loudly booed off at the final whistle although many fans had long since trudged off.
United's fourth home league defeat of the season hardly inspired much hope ahead of next week's must-win game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.
For Bournemouth, who won with goals by Dominic Solanke, Philip Billing and Marcos Senesi, it was a fourth victory in five league games and their relegation fears are rapidly receding.
They took the lead after five minutes when Lewis Cook burst through a non-existent United defence and squared the ball for Solanke to finish tidily.
United were finally beginning to threaten an equaliser in the second half but were floored by two goals in five minutes for Bournemouth -- Billing and Senesi both scoring with thumping headers from Marcus Tavernier deliveries, as United's defence went AWOL.
Bournemouth hunted for more goals and were denied a very late fourth when Dango Ouattara bundled through and netted but his effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
Bournemouth's victory did not flatter them in the slightest and the south-coast club are up to the relative safety of 13th place. For sixth-placed United it remains one step forward and two steps back as they undid all the good work of Wednesday's impressive victory over Chelsea.

Returning officer Justice (retd) MM Kumar on Saturday issued a fresh notification drawing up a revised schedule. According to it, the polling (during the WFI special general body meeting), counting and declaration of results will all be done in a single day. The election was originally scheduled on August 12. The nomination process was completed and the final list of candidates drawn up when the Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the election on a writ petition by the de-recognised Haryana federation.
The Supreme Court vacated the stay on November 28, paving the way for the process to resume. The court directed the returning officer to issue a revised election programme. The apex court order though stipulates that the results will be subject to the outcome of the plea pending before the high court.
“The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide its order dated 28.11.2023 has vacated the stay orders and therefore the remaining steps like polling, etc. will now recommence on 21.12.2023 as per the following revised schedule,” said the notification, adding that as per WFI constitution 10 days’ notice has been given.
Outgoing WFI president and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused by six women wrestlers of sexual harassment and is facing trial in a Delhi lower court, still enjoys huge clout within the federation having governed WFI for 12 years. His supporters have filed nominations for all 15 posts. Singh’s close associate Sanjay Kumar Singh of Uttar Pradesh is standing for the president’s post.
A second group which has the support of wrestlers who protested against Singh is also in the fray for the top posts. Former wrestler and 2010 Commonwealth Games gold medallist, Anita Sheoran, who is with the Haryana Police official and is a witness in the sexual harassment case, is standing against Sanjay Singh. Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB) secretary Prem Chand Lochab – a key mediator between the protesting wrestlers and the government – is in the fray for the secretary general’s post, while former wrestler and senior superintendent with the Jammu and Kashmir Police, Dushyant Sharma, has pitched himself for the treasurer’s post.
While Singh’s faction enjoys majority support, the possibility of a compromise on some of the key posts cannot be ruled out, according to people aware of the developments.
On Friday, the ad-hoc committee announced that the senior nationals will be hosted by RSPB in Jaipur from January 2-5. It will be the first domestic event to be organised after a gap of nine months.
The elections are important for the world body – United World Wrestling (UWW) -- to remove its suspension of WFI. Indian wrestlers currently can’t compete under the India flag because of the suspension. They took part as neutral athletes at the September world championships in Serbia. Antim Panghal won bronze and India’s first quota for the Paris Olympics.
The wrestling fraternity will hope the elections to go off smoothly as it has already faced several delays due to the barred state associations petitioning the courts.
Last week, the Haryana Amateur Wrestling Association (HAWA) president Rohtas Singh appealed to the ad-hoc committee to go through the entire election process again, alleging that the final list of the electoral college and candidates flouted the government’s National Sports Code. He said some states need to be heard again with a “fresh schedule of election”.

The former Manchester United star was scheduled to visit the country from December 15 to 17 but the tour has to be delayed due to some unavoidable reasons.
“I was very excited to visit India since the day I heard about the craze of football and Manchester United’s fan base from Tilak. Sadly, the tour has to be postponed this time due some unavoidable circumstances. However, I will be coming to India in February to meet the fans and witness the fandom personally,” said Solskjaer.
Hosted by the Manchester United fan and founder of Ace of Pubs, Tilak Gaurang Shah, the three-city tour was slated to take place in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi.
“It’s unfortunate that Ole’s India tour has to be postponed. It’s an inevitable situation and I hope the fans will understand. I have discussed the revised plan with him and we are very excited to host the Manchester United legend for his first-ever India tour,” Tilak informed.
Solskjaer is a renowned name in the football world and enjoys a huge fan base in India as well. The former Manchester United manager is also among the leading scorers for the club with 126 goals in 366 appearances for the club. His sensational last-minute winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich is still fresh in the memories of football fans across the world.

SPORTS,"Russians, Belarusians to participate at Paris Olympics as neutrals: IOC",https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/russians-belarusians-to-participate-at-paris-olympics-as-neutrals-ioc-101702091329731.html,"Russians and Belarusians who qualify in their sport for the Paris 2024 Olympics can take part as neutrals without flags, emblems or anthems at the event next year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday.
Russians and Belarusians had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, for which Belarus has been used as a staging ground.
In March, however, the IOC issued a first set of recommendations for international sports federations to allow Russian and Belarusian competitors to return and they have since done so in most events.
Athletics, the Games' biggest sport, is unlikely to open the door for them to return to competition, however, after banning them following the invasion and sticking to it on Friday.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned what he said was a ""shameful"" IOC decision while Russia's Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the conditions set by the IOC for Russian athletes' participation at the Olympics ""discriminatory.""
""The Executive Board (EB) of the IOC has decided that Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) who have qualified through the existing qualification systems of the International Federations (IFs) on the field of play will be declared eligible to compete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024,"" the Olympic body said in a statement.
""Individual Neutral Athletes are athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport.""
The neutral athletes will compete only in individual sports and no teams for the two countries will be allowed. Athletes who actively support the war in Ukraine are not eligible, nor are those contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military.
The IOC also said no Russian or Belarusian government or state official would be invited to or accredited for Paris 2024.
But athletes, it added, should not be punished for the actions of their governments.
While Paris Games organisers 'took note' of the IOC decision, there were angry responses from Ukraine and Russia.
""The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics,"" Ukraine's foreign minister Kuleba said on X.
""Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare. I urge all partners to strongly condemn this shameful decision, which undermines Olympic principles,"" Kuleba added.
Ukraine's sports minister Matviy Bidniy said on Telegram: ""The irresponsible decision by the IOC Executive Board enables Russian and Belarusian athletes to hide behind fake neutrality.
""We explained to our international partners and the Olympic Committee that Russian athletes have the same passports as occupiers who kill Ukrainians. And that means they bear the same responsibility for the deaths of Ukrainians. In a time of war, they cannot hide behind the white flag of ""neutrality"".
""Regarding Ukraine's participation in the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, we will make a decision later, after consulting with the Ukrainian sports community and the country's top political leadership,"" Bidniy added.
Russia's Sports Minister Matytsin said the IOC's approach was ""unacceptable"".
""Participation in the Olympics is an athlete’s dream. But the conditions are discriminatory and go against the principles of sports,"" he was quoted by TASS news agency.
""By doing so, they harm the Olympic Games themselves, and not Russian sports. The approach is absolutely unacceptable.""
Out of 4,600 athletes globally who have so far qualified for the Games, which open on July 26, eight are Russians and three hold Belarusian passports. More than 60 Ukrainians have qualified.
Athletics’ suspension of Russia for state-sponsored doping was lifted this year but, after the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow called a ""special military operation"", all Russians and Belarusians were banned from the sport.
In response to the IOC decision on Friday, World Athletics (WA) said: ""All athletes, support personnel and officials from Russia and Belarus are excluded from all World Athletics Series events, and from hosting any International or European athletics events.
""We will continue to monitor the situation but unless there is a major change in circumstances between now and the Olympic Games, this exclusion will apply to Paris 2024.
""It is the IOC’s remit to decide which countries are invited to participate at the Olympic Games, but it is the responsibility of the IFs (international federations) to decide which athletes within their sport are eligible to compete.""
At August’s World Championships in Budapest, WA president Sebastian Coe said it would have been ""inconceivable"" for Russians and Belarusians to have competed, saying that the ban was for ""reasons of integrity"".

Having shared the update on social media while reiterating the importance of getting checkups, Evert also added that she won't be able to be part of ESPN's 2024 Australian Open coverage which will begin from January 14 onwards in Melbourne.
“While this is a diagnosis I never wanted to hear, I once again feel fortunate that it was caught early,” Evert said in a statement shared by ESPN. “Based on a PET CT scan, I underwent another robotic surgery this past week. Doctors found cancer cells in the same pelvic region. All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy.
“I encourage everyone to know your family history and advocate for yourself.”
Exactly two years back, Evert had opted for preventative hysterectomy after she lost her sister Jeanne, 62, to ovarian cancer. It was during the procedure that she discovered that she had a malignant tumor in the fallopian tube, which was eventually a stage 1C ovarian cancer diagnosis. She later underwent six rounds of chemotherapy before being cleared in January this year by the doctors, who then added that Evert only had 10 per cent chance of cancer recurrence.
Evert later joined the ESPN team yet again, was present at Stade Roland Garros to hand over the winning trophy to Iga Swiatek and was also in Cancun for the WTA Finals.
In a message to all as part of her statement, Evert added: “Early detection saves lives. Be thankful for your health this holiday season.”
“I’ll be ready for the rest of the Grand Slam season!”

SPORTS,Wrestling domestic season to begin after 9 months,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/wrestling-domestic-season-to-begin-after-9-months-101702053031776.html,"Domestic wrestling competition will resume after nine months as the Senior National Championships will be held in Jaipur from January 2-5, the ad hoc committee announced on Friday.
Wrestling competitions at every age-group level came to a complete halt since the suspension of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) in April following the protests by top wrestlers against former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. Teams for major international competitions and the Asian Games were picked after open trials were held by the ad hoc committee. But the biggest drawback was that no national camp could be held this year.
After the National Championships, the national campers will be picked and preparation will begin for the two Paris Olympics qualifiers. The championships will be organised by the Railways Sports Promotion Board.
""The ad hoc Committee for WFI has decided to organise the 2023 Senior freestyle, Greco Roman and women’s National Wrestling Championships from Jan 2 to 5, 2024,"" said the notification.
It remains to seen whether top wrestlers Ravi Dahiya, Vinesh Phogat and Anshu Malik, who are all recovering from various injuries, will compete or not. Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Bajrang Punia, who competed at the Asian Games, would like to begin his season with the national championship.
The two vital events will be Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan from April 19-21 and World Olympic Qualifiers in Turkey from May 9-12. The ad hoc committee has already announced that wrestlers, who earn Paris Olympics quotas, will have to win selection trials at home to confirm their spots.

SPORTS,Golf ball rollback good for the game and environment,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/golf-ball-rollback-is-good-for-the-game-and-environment-the-latter-argument-should-shut-up-the-critics-if-nothing-else-101702037547514.html,"The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) and United States Golf Association (USGA) have at last managed to have their way with the PGA Tour and DP World Tour. Yes, the rollback of the golf ball has been approved and will be set in motion in January 2028. It’s a huge development in the golf world. Basically, what it means is that the golfers will not be able to hit the ball too far heading into 2028. The ball specifications will be changed so that it travels around 15 yards less for elite golfers and five for recreational ones.
It's going to change the landscape of the golfing world in a big way. First, let’s understand why the rule makers decided in favour of limiting golf ball distances despite opposition from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour at first. Also from many top golfers! Basically, what was happening... because of big distances hit by players, golf courses had started to look small. Golf courses with smaller yardage had begun to lose significance. Also, some golf courses were forced to increase their yardage on certain holes to be able to keep up with the big-hitting golfers.
This is exactly what has forced the rule makers to introduce the new guidelines. There is not enough space to enlarge the golf courses. There is not enough land to make new golf courses. Even if it is there, it is going to cost a lot of money. Bigger courses mean a lot of construction work which is not environment-friendly. Not just that, bigger courses mean bigger yardage and it’s going to require a lot of water to maintain the verdure all around. Since golfers can hit it big nowadays, it has also led to a lot of waste of time, in case the ball goes out of bounds or injures someone in the gallery. Last but not least, by limiting the distance the importance of skills in the game will take the ascendancy again. In the last few years, ‘hitting it big’ has taken a lot of spotlight.
So one would think the rollback is going to help the game at all levels and there can’t be any opposition to it, right? Sadly, that’s not the case. The golf world is at present cut in half with many top golfers not buying into the idea. But then there are players like world number two Rory McIlroy who is all for it. Which is quite commendable since the Northern Irishman is by far the biggest hitter of the golf ball at present, sometimes going upwards of 320 yards. So he is going to suffer most but the 34-year-old doesn’t care. He is game for anything that ensures the sustainability of the game. It also reflects his confidence in his overall game.
Two-time major winner Justin Thomas and Keegan Bradley are not happy on the other hand for one reason or another. LPGA players are not happy either. The legendary Annika Sorenstam has questioned the decision, which is understandable since women golfers are going to bear the brunt of limiting distances more -- as it is they hit it shorter compared to men.
Earlier, the R&A and the USGA had planned it a little differently. They wanted the change only for elite golf, not for people who play the game for fun. But the bifurcation plan didn’t receive much support and as a result, the rule makers had to apply the rollback to all -- no one excepted, in short. However, the change for recreational golfers will come into effect from 2030.
""Governance is not the easiest thing in the world to do, especially in golf. But we have a responsibility to the long-term future of the game and we have to be cognizant of our environmental responsibility. We can't keep making golf courses longer and it isn't just the courses that tour golf is played on. You see this growth in distance right through elite amateur golf down to junior level,"" R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers told BBC Sport.
Since the rule makers have managed to convince both the important tours, it’s an indication their argument had a lot of weight to it. Particularly, the bit that touches on it being environment friendly. If everything else doesn’t make sense to the critics of the rollback, it being eco-friendly should strike a chord with them. The world is facing a massive environmental crisis. Every step, no matter how small it is, should be supported and embraced wholeheartedly.

It was the area that proved to be the pivotal factor in the 2015 champions incurring a forgettable 2022, where they had finished ninth on the points table. But U Mumba made their amends. Courtesy of an auction strategy Gholamreza Mazandarani, who is back onboard as a coach, U Mumba roped in two players from Iran - Alireza Mirzaeian and Amirmohammad Zafardanesh - to strengthen their raiding department. And the franchise witnessed the Iranian impact instantly. Although U Mumba won their opener and lost their second tie so far in the 2023 season, Zafardanesh made a fine start to his time at the franchise. The youngster led the charge with 11 points in U Mumba's 34-31 win against U.P. Yoddhas at the EKA Arena by TransStadia in Ahmedabad on Saturday before PKL witnessed a couple of lightning-quick raids from Zafardanesh in the team's loss against Gujarat Giants on Tuesday.
Speaking to Hindustan Times Digital, Surinder opened up on the U Mumba squad for the 2023 season and the importance of the addition of Mazandarani in the wake of back-to-back disappointing seasons. Here are excerpts...
More than returning back, I am more excited that this season we will be able to play in front of our home fans and in rest of the cities as well. We kind of fell slightly congested during Covid times, but all is well now.
My PKL career itself started with U Mumba, so I know the team better than any other side. What I have felt is that like those in the management, Sandeep and Rehan sir, they both treat us like we are part of a family, like brothers. Hence, the communication between the players and the management is also great.
This time we also got a chance to train for close to 20 days at the Olympic High Performance Centre which was great. The main aspect of it was the information we gained on diet and the foods we need to take. Overall, it was very motivating. The players bonded well during the entire process.
It was a huge responsibility that was given to me last season and I gave my 100 per cent to it. As far I feel, I did do a decent job, but unfortunately I got injured and things went haywire. In the first 11 games, U Mumba looked great with the combination that we had, but post the injury and me getting ruled out, our team began to fall behind.
I learnt a lot from Anup Kumar and Fazel Atrachali, who was in fact my roommate for two seasons, and tried to implement those aspects during the matches, especially the part about keeping the team motivated even when they are trailing. Moreover, in preparing for matches we do use a lot of data and video analysis to work on the weakness of the opponent team, but during the match, situations tend to change, and it is all about taking decisions right then, so I was able to understand and successful take those calls as well.
The team is looking very strong. With Girish Ernak on the left, Rinku on the right, we also got Mahendra Singh as left cover. So the defence is definitely outstanding, I would say. In the raiding department, last season Ghuman Singh did not get that support because only one raider worked for us, but this time we have Pranay Rane and Jai Bhagwan, who were both young players from the last edition, but look more mature and stronger this time. We also have two Iranian players (Alireza Mirzaeian and Amirmohammad Zafardanesh) have joined the squad. I feel there is a good competition even among the players to make it to the playing team.
We also believe in grooming youngsters and giving them more opportunities so that they can make the most of it and emerge as top players.
This time we have Gholamreza Mazandarani of Iran as our coach. None of the Indian players knew anything about these two Iranian players. Only Gholamreza sir knew how good they are and how strong they would make our squad. And we trusted that because Alireza and Zafardanesh were not in the plans of any other franchises. Ghuman is going to get a lot of support this time.
Gholamreza sir is an outstanding coach. He breathes kabaddi. And he tends to explain every minute aspects when we are training for matches. And my equation with him is also very good.
There are a lot of youngsters in the team, two of which are from Iran. So it is a big opportunity for all these players and I motivated them a lot. I told them that this is their first season and it could have a huge impact on their career in PKL. I also told the entire squad that reaching the final is the aim and that is what matters in PKL. We have to give our 100 per cent in every game and think more about the team and less about individual performance.
Pranay Rane. Then in defense there are Bittu and Sombir. There are also Mukilan Shanmugam and Gokulakannan M, who are excellent covers.

Played in a two-legged format, the season five of Harven PTL sees eight teams divided into two groups, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals. Indraprastha Warriors, Ichiban Samurai, defending champions Gurgaon Sapphires, Mumbai Acers have been drawn into Group A. Meanwhile, inaugural season’s winners Sankara Stag Babolat Yoddhas, DMG Delhi Crusaders, Lucknow Aviators and last year’s runners-up Paramount Proec Tigers were slotted into Group B.

Also, the opening ceremony of the Harven PTL Season 5 took place ahead of the first game on Thursday and it was attended by Dr. Anil Jain – President of the All India Tennis Association (AITA).
Speaking about the upcoming season, PTL co-founder Aditya Khanna said at the press conference, “For me any sport is not about the sport but also about the environment which is created around it. This year we've created a fan park, a food festival, we've upgraded on social media as well. We've tied up with 50 academies in Delhi to bring people to the stadium. We've got hoardings outside the stadium and everywhere. We've tied up with sports channels like Sportzworkz to show the tournament on their YouTube channel as well. We have a commentator from Sony, Saarthak Lal who will be commenting live to make the viewing experience really good.”
“So, it is not just about the tennis but also about creating a festive environment so people can come with their families to watch tennis and have a good time,” he added.
The players acknowledged that the league offers them an opportunity to train alongside their peers and is a wonderful avenue to have fun at the closing stages of the season.
""I liked the idea of all the players coming together, getting to train with everyone... The whole year we're mostly away on tournaments and barely see each other. Even if we see each other, it's on the ITFs and we just do our thing and go. But here it is about coming together, take our minds off some things and learn from other players,"" said Sahaja Yamalapalli who was snapped up by the Acers for 44 lakh fantasy points in the auction.
Vishnu Vardhan, who played for India at the 2012 London Olympics, recalled the first season when comparing it with the upcoming season. ""The first edition was kind of a home-run kind of league. It has definitely grown. The best thing is that it has been sustainable. Of course the aim is to grow the league but it is also important to remain sustainable. The most important thing is that the owners are very passionate about the sport and they support players. I hope they continue doing that and it is a great platform for players of different age groups to come on and play. I definitely have a lot of fun playing this league,"" he said.

The troika of Grand Slam winners will be joined by another former winner at the Melbourne Park with Caroline Wozniacki awarded one of the first wild cards for the 2024 Australian Open. However, former Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios and 2021 US Open winner Emma Raducanu are among the notable absentees from the list.
Kyrgios, former world No. 13, had missed the Australian Open last January owing to a knee surgery. He was slated to return to action in Wimbledon after having played a couple of matches, but was forced to withdraw after tearing a ligament in his wrist. The Aussie has since been out of the tour. Australian Open boss Craig Tiley however remains hopeful that Kyrgios will be present in Melbourne for the Slam in in “some form” and added that he could be granted a wildcard.
Raducanu, who has been out of action since April owing to multiple surgeries, missed out on the automatic entry list after having a protected ranking of 103. The 21-year-old was also not named among the initial batch of wild cards handed out by Australian Open on Thursday, which implies that she will have to go through the qualifiers.
Wozniacki, the 2018 Australian Open women’s champion, was a however the first wild cards for the 2024 Australian Open, along with six Aussie players. The 33-year-old had come out of retirement after three years earlier in August as she played in Montreal and Cincinnati before making a run to the fourth round of the US Open.
Nadal and Osaka are expected to make a blockbuster Grand Slam return after making an appearance in Brisbane international. The Spaniard has been out of action since January this year after incurring a hip injury in his second-round loss and has a protected ranking of nine. Osaka, on the other hand, who gave birth to daughter Shai in July, has been out of WTA action since September 2022. The two-time champion at the Melbourne Park has a special ranking - used by the WTA for players returning from pregnancy leave - of 46.

The Merseyside club had been plunged into the bottom three of England's top flight by a 10-point deduction last month for breaching the league's financial rules.
But it has responded in impressive fashion with back-to-back wins to lift it up to 17th in the standings — one point above the drop zone.
Second-half goals from Dwight McNeil, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Beto sealed the victory against Newcastle at Goodison Park.
Newcastle had beaten Manchester United 1-0 last weekend but missed the chance to move within a point of fourth-place Manchester City.
But the visitors were behind in the 79th when McNeil drove into the box and fired a left-footed shot that deflected into the corner beyond goalkeeper Martin Dubravka.
Doucoure doubled Everton's lead seven minutes later and Beto made it 3-0 in the 96th.
Without the 10-point deduction Everton would be 10th and just six points behind seventh-place Newcastle. Instead, even after Thursday's win, it is 10 places below Eddie Howe's team.

Second-half goals from Jarrod Bowen and James Ward-Prowse saw West Ham recover from going behind to an early header from Cristian Romero.
Defeat means Tottenham has now lost four and drawn one of its last five games — after having taken the lead in all of them.
The slump has dropped Ange Postecoglou's team from first to fifth, while West Ham is now three points behind its London rival in ninth.
Tottenham was ultimately punished for failing to make the most of its superiority in the first half.
It was in front after 11 minutes when Romero rose to head home Pedro Porro's corner.
The score could have been 2-0 in first-half stoppage time when West Ham defender Kurt Zouma fired the ball against his own post while cutting out a dangerous cross.
If that was a spot of good fortune for West Ham, its equalizer in the 52nd also came after a large slice of luck.
Mohammed Kudus lined up a shot from outside the area that looked unlikely to pose too much threat to Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario until it ricocheted off Ben Davies and Romero. The ball then ran invitingly for Bowen with only the keeper to beat and he smashed his shot into the back of the net.
Tottenham substitute Richarlison came closest to restoring his team's lead with a header that went narrowly wide before West Ham struck the winner in the 74th.
Spurs were victims of their own downfall as Destiny Udogie hit a weak backpass to Vicario. Bowen raced onto it and while the keeper was able to push the ball away, it fell to Ward-Prowse with the goal to aim at.
His first effort struck the post, but he was alert enough to follow up and convert from the rebound.

SPORTS,Time running out for pistol shooters to book flight to Paris,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/time-running-out-for-pistol-shooters-to-book-flight-to-paris-101701972837586.html,"A mind-boggling 1200 shooters participated in men’s air pistol event at the Senior National Championships in Bhopal culminating in the final on Thursday after 11 days of competition in just one event. The scores in the qualification round and final were world class — as high as the World Championships in Baku this year. Encouraging it might seem just seven months before the Paris Olympics, but the reality is different. There is still an Olympic quota to be won from the event and there is no guarantee that such high scores will be replicated in the next international competition, which will be a Paris Olympic qualifier in Jakarta in January.
Out of eight quotas for pistol events at the Paris Olympics, the Indian shooters have managed to grab just three so far. The big struggle has been in air pistol events where of the four Paris quotas on offer, only one (Sarabjot Singh) has come India’s way. The remaining three have to be sealed over the next two qualifiers and it will be a big ask to grab all of them.
Going into the Tokyo Olympics, India had all four quotas in their kitty and it was the air pistol team, including the mixed pair of Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker that was being looked at as medal prospects. What happened in Tokyo is a different story altogether, but it will be no exaggeration to surmise that in pistol shooting, especially in air pistol, India’s performance in international events in the last two seasons has left a lot to be desired. The Asian Games showing of young shooters Palak Gulia and Esha Singh — they had a gold-silver finish in women’s air pistol — though has stoked hopes that they can win the two quota places.
The men’s air pistol team has also been inconsistent. Both Sarabjot, who won quota at the Asian Championships last month, and young Shiva Narwal — the most promising shooter at the moment — are still work in progress. The two big names — Tokyo Olympians Chaudhary and Abhishek Verma — are struggling to even make it to the India team. It’s a complete turnaround from the Tokyo cycle when these two had swept the gold medals in the World Cup series in the buildup to the Games.
It has been learnt that NRAI high performance director Pierre Beauchamp had raised concerns over the performance of pistol shooters earlier this year after the World Cup in Bhopal in March and had a talk with the top brass of the federation.
“He wanted certain changes in the coaching set-up. He thought the top shooters were not getting enough rest and recovery time and it was adding to the pressure and that a plan was needed to be in place for better management of their training and competition schedule,” according to NRAI officials aware of the development.
However, it seems none of that has been implemented so far.
After the debacle at the Tokyo Games, NRAI did not retain foreign coach Pavel Smirnov and appointed two-time Olympic medallist Munkhbayar Dorjsuren in his place. Samresh Jung, who was part of the coaching set-up for Tokyo, was retained as chief national coach.
“There has to be planning to see that the shooters are not burnt out. After Tokyo, the top shooters should not have competed for six to seven months and should have started gradually. But they were back shooting at trials within 15 days. Was there any plan to make sure that top shooters like Chaudhary and Verma were monitored as they made their way back?” said a coach.
While there is not much time to rectify things, NRAI has reached out to Verma to provide any support of the high-performance team. Confirming the development, Verma said he was happy to receive any support. “NRAI senior vice-president Kalikesh Singh Deo and other officials spoke to me and asked me if I would like to work with HPD Pierre Beauchamp. I am thankful because and I am looking forward to some sessions with him,” he said.
“My focus is on Paris. After Tokyo, I took a break in 2022 and then I started from scratch. I changed my weapon, technique, everything. In Tokyo, I shot my lowest score in a long time and I wanted to experiment and innovate to improve for Paris,” said Verma.
Verma has been working on his own. “I decided to train myself. Though I did look for a mentor in India and outside but foreign coaches are very costly. I am not in TOPS anymore, so it is difficult,” said Verma, adding that his accommodation and training at the Karni Singh range is taken care of.

SPORTS,Jaded India no match for Spain's pace,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/jaded-india-no-match-for-spains-pace-101701967426047.html,"Spain thrashed India 4-1 in their group match ongoing Junior World Cup to go top of the table in Pool C, in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. Both India and Spain were coming off convincing wins in the previous encounters — India had beaten South Korea 4-2 on Tuesday while Spain blanked Canada 7-0 — but Spain, led by braces from skipper Rafi Andreas and Cabre Verdiell Pol, proved too hot to handle for India.
Spain got off the blocks early and found the opening goal in the first minute itself through an unmarked Pol who beat goalkeeper Shashikumar Honnenahalli with a lovely deflection. Rohit drew level for India in the 33rd minute through a penalty corner but a tactically superior Spain were significantly better than the Indians who appeared jaded on the pitch.
Spain were superb on the wings and played a close-knit game, allowing little room to the Indian forwards. Andreas restored the lead for Spain in the 18th minute through a PC before Pol converted another PC in the 41st minute. Andreas then put the result beyond doubt with a penalty stroke in the last minute of regulation time to unwittingly underscore his team's domination from the first minute to the last.
Spain goalkeeper Capellades Jan stood out for his pluck and anticipation, saving a handful of sure-shot strikes from Indian forwards.
India earned three penalty corners between the 55th and 57th minutes but Capellades put his body on the line to deny them success.
Overall, India had more circle penetrations (18 to Spain's 16) and penalty corners (six to Spain's seven) but Spain had more shots on goal (13 as compared to India's 10) and, eventually, goals. Spain pressed with pace and scored in each quarter while the 2016 champions were left chasing the game. India will next play Canada on Saturday while Spain will square off against South Korea. India and Korea are currently level on points but the latter occupy the second spot in Pool C owing to better goal difference. Canada, with two losses in as many outings, occupy the fourth spot.

SPORTS,Squash's Olympics tag adds wheels to Anahat's go pro drive,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/others/squashs-olympics-tag-adds-wheels-to-anahats-go-pro-drive-101701966907205.html,"Moments after squash was included as one of the new sports for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics at October's IOC Session in Mumbai, Saurav Ghosal, India's top squash professional aged 37, chuckled that he wished he was 10 years younger.
Anahat Singh, the reigning women’s national champion, is 15. This year's U-17 Asian junior gold medallist, she grabbed a couple of medals at the Hangzhou Asian Games — a bronze each in the women's team and mixed doubles with Abhay Singh. By far the brightest young talent in the country’s squash circuit, the soft-spoken teen from Delhi felt the timing of the belated Olympics tag couldn’t have been better from an Indian perspective, having come days after the squash contingent’s creditable five-medal Asian Games show.
“It was almost like a miracle. Really exciting,"" said Anahat, the glee on her face while talking about it truly bringing out her age. What follows, however, is another reminder of her being unlike many other 15-year-olds.
“There's still five years left. But the Olympics is such a big deal that you need to start training for it from, like, now. You need that amount of time. Hopefully, I'll get to play there,"" she said.
While that is still a while away, what squash’s Olympics inclusion has done for now is give a clear roadmap to Anahat’s fledging career that could meet a few crossroads. Her elder sister Amira, whose footsteps Anahat followed into squash, took the college route with the sport and is currently pursuing her degree at Harvard University as part of its squash roster. Anahat, due to appear for her Class 10 exams in a few months, had been leaning the other way in her mind even though the college option remains on the cards. Destination Olympics, though, has only added wheels to her go pro drive.
“I was always somewhat sure that I would want to go pro. I really love playing this sport. But yes, this (Olympics inclusion) does give me a definite direction. It's going to be a target which I'm going to be working towards for the next five years,"" said Anahat sitting by the squash courts of Cricket Club of India here on Thursday.
""I know for the next five years that I'm going to be 100% serious about squash because the Olympics will be the next big goal. So, it does change my approach quite a bit — in terms of the amount of training and the amount of work that I'm going to put in. Because it is an athlete's dream to win a medal at the Olympics.”
At 15, Anahat has already been to the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, richer with experience from the former and medals from the latter. She has pocketed age-group medals at the prestigious British Junior Open (U-11 in 2019 and U-17 in 2023) and US Junior Open (U-15 in 2021), ticking off boxes that the stars of Indian squash — Ghosal, Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal Karthik — did in their junior days. For her age, it’s about those little steps, although Anahat isn’t shying away from drawing out a five-year plan.
“I mean, I do have to look at it from the long-term view. I'm still playing the juniors for the next three years, so it has to be step by step and tournament by tournament. At the same time, that is going to be the long-term goal: to win a medal at the Olympics. But before that there are other things as well, like winning PSA (Professional Squash Association) tournaments and some top junior events,” she said.
Already making her mark in the senior national circuit (she won the 2023 title after Tanvi Khanna retired in the final and lost the 2022 final to Joshana), one of Anahat’s goals for next year is to start competing in more PSA world tour events to climb up the world rankings. “I'm going to start playing more of the senior tournaments and less junior events,"" she said.
Juggling both this year has meant her “tournaments have almost doubled”. Right after the Asian Games, she turned up for the senior nationals last month. Currently in Mumbai for the CCI-Western India Slam Squash Championship, she will head out for another junior tournament later this month. The difference in level from the juniors to seniors is evident for Anahat, who believes playing the latter has helped her while competing in the top junior world events.
“Seniors is a lot more physical. There, your whole career is squash, you're working towards it day and night and everyone wants to just win no matter what,"" she said. “The amount of training that the seniors do, the precision of their shots and their fitness overall is much better than the junior level.”

The 37-year-old has been out of action since last January, when he hurt his hip flexor during a defeat in the second round of the Australian Open.
Then fast forward to May, a little more than a week before the start of the French Open, the Spaniard announced that he would miss the Grand Slam event, and he wasn't sure about the exact date of his return.
Now in a recent video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, he spoke about the possibility of 2024 being his final year of competitive tennis. ""It is a reality, there are many chances that it will be my last year without any doubt. There are chances that it may only be half a year, there are possibilities it may be a full year, that we may not be able to reach all that.. these are things right now I do not have the capacity to be able to answer, this is the truth,"" he said.
""I am only in conditions to say that I return to compete, that I continue having in my head that the normal thing, or that there are many possibilities that it is my last year, and I am going to enjoy the tournaments in that way,"" he added.

Furthermore, he explained that he hasn't officially decided on retirement yet, as he wanted to see how he performs and it would depend on that. ""I do not want to announce it because in the end I do not know what can happen and I have to give myself the opportunity not to say one thing and then I can be a slave of what I have said,"" he said.
""I think it is going to be like that, but I can't be 100% sure because in the end I have worked a lot to come back to compete and if suddenly things and my physique allows me to continue and enjoy what I do.. why am I going to set a deadline? I think it makes no sense,"" he added.

A brace by Ahmed Jahouh (31', 45+3') in the first-half saw Odisha take a 2-0 lead. But Armando Sadiku (58', 90+4') got a second-half brace as Mohun Bagan made it 2-2 and both sides failed to get the winner.
After the final whistle, the action just didn't end there as fans were treated to some controversial drama. As the players and staff of both teams walked to the field for the post-match proceedings, Mohun Bagan head coach Juan Ferrando and Odisha attacker Roy Krishna were involved in an explosive altercation.
In a video, which has gone viral on social media, the pair could be seen arguing rather aggressively, pointing fingers and it looked like it was going to get violent. But the other players and staff stopped the duo and separated them, with Krishna pushing Ferrando and then walking off.
Here is the video:

When it looked like the situation was calming down, Odisha head coach Sergio Lobera rushed to defend his player Diego Mauricio, and then another altercation began. After the situation was settled, the referee showed Ferrando a direct red card and a second yellow for Mauricio, which resulted in a red.
In the post-match press conference, Lobera said, ""We started the game very well but at the end, we lost two valuable points today, we need to analyse what went wrong in the second half. We had chances to turn the scoreline to 3-1 in our favour. If we had scored the third goal, the game would have been over. I am proud of my players for the intensity and fight that they showed throughout the game, but I am not happy with the result.""

The news comes after Messi won the 2023 Ballon d'Or for a record-extending eighth time, further elevating his status in football folklore.
Messi played a key role in Argentina's victorious 2022 World Cup campaign, where he led them to the title, defeating France in the final. He was adjudged as the tournament's Best Player and was also the second-highest goalscorer.
Despite his World Cup victory, Messi failed to replicate similar form with PSG and departed them as a free agent in this year's summer transfer window. His time in PSG could be considered a disappointment by his standards and he was also frequently jeered by the fans.
Initially, he was expected to return to Barcelona, whom he left in shocking circumstances in 2021 as a free agent, joining PSG. The development occurred after Barcelona couldn't afford a new contract for him. But once again the Catalan club couldn't afford him, and then he rejected offers from the Saudi Pro League, to join MLS side Inter Miami, which is also co-owned by former player David Beckham.
Explaining his transfer to Inter Miami, Messi told Time, ""The truth is that fortunately, I had several options on the table that were interesting, and I had to analyze them and think, even weigh them up with my family, before making the final decision to come to Miami.""
""My first option was to return to Barcelona, but it was not possible. I tried to return, and it did not happen. It is also true that later I was thinking a lot about going to the Saudi league, where I know the country and they have created a very powerful competition that can become an important league in the near future.
""As the country’s tourism ambassador, it was a destination that attracted me, especially because I’ve enjoyed everything I have visited, because of how football is growing in the country and because of the effort they are putting into creating a top competition. it was Saudi Arabia or MLS, and both options seemed very interesting to me,"" he added.

SPORTS,‘My head almost fell off’: Braun Strowman shares chilling details on neck injury,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/wwe-news/my-head-almost-fell-off-braun-strowman-shares-chilling-details-on-neck-injury-as-he-waits-for-doctors-green-light-101701885497672.html,"Braun Strowman has been one of the leading figures in WWE, having won almost all the titles in a career spanning over 10 years. Despite the success, the Monster Among Men has experienced a fair share of ups and downs. Not very long ago, 2021 to be exact, he was let go by WWE, following which fans often spotted him in independent circuits. However, that didn't last very long as WWE recalled the 6ft8' tall wrestler a year later. Strowman made an explosive return on Monday Night Raw, where he crashed an eight-men tag team match, a moment which became an instant hit among the fans.
While things were going smooth, Strowman was hit by a personal loss. His long time friend Bray Wyatt passed away due to heart attack. While fans have moved on from the tragic loss, Strowman still gets emotional talking about his bond with Bray.
And that is not the end as a neck injury has now kept Strowman on the sidelines for over six months. While he continues to recover well from it, chances of him returning anytime soon appears slim.
Strowman at present is on a promotional tour in India. In an exclusive interview with Hindustan Times in New Delhi on Wednesday evening, the Monster Among Men spoke in length about his journey, release, and his memories of The Wyatt Family, a legacy that he now looks forward to expand.
Ups and downs, that's life. It is not rainbow and sunshine all the time. Sometimes you got to go through the weather and that's been it with my career with injuries and certain business decisions that were out of my control.
But at the end of the day I'm home where I belong and I love what I do. I'm truly blessed to represent this company and travel around the world and do what I do. So it's great to be back home with the WWE. I'm looking forward to getting back in the ring and do what I love.
I always laugh that I took a year unpaid vacation. When I was gone from the company I still stayed in contact with everyone, I'm friends with everybody as at the end of the day we're a giant family.
It was a hard pill to swallow as nobody wants to get fired from their dream job. But business is business. However, the business decision needed to be changed because look what I've done. Since I came back I've broke records for most views on live segments, on television doing more than the Rock. He drew 3.4 million. Ricochet and I versus the Usos drew 3.7 million eyes, which is one of the highest viewed segments in the last 10 years on SmackDown.
So the proof is in the pudding. The Monster belongs on WWE, on television because the fans want to see it. And injuries happen, it's unfortunate. We were starting to get rolling with Ricochet and unfortunately injury happened. But, that's life. You talk about the ups and downs, everything can't be great all the time.
10 years of my life I've dedicated to this business, to this company and it's gone by really, really fast.
So I'm looking forward to getting back into the ring and continuing to push my story, continuing to carve my name in this great business.
I had a cervical fusion on my C4 and C5. So basically my head almost fell off and they had to take a metal plate and four screws to keep it from falling off.
I recently got cleared, a couple weeks ago to start weight training again but still no contact, no blows on the head, no bump stuff. WWE takes unbelievable care of the athletes like they did with me. They sent me to Dr. Cordover at the world famous Andrew's medical center, Birmingham, Alabama. He's the number one surgeon in the world for this procedure. So I felt really confident going in with that. He's so happy with my recovery. I'm right on pace where we need to be. Unfortunately it's a slow recovery when you're talking bones fusing back together, so I'm at the mercy of that. But as soon as they give me the green light to go, I'm gonna get it. And you'll know when I'm back.
At the end of the day whatever's best for business is best for me and he's drawing views, he's putting butts in seats and that's our job, because it's a business. First and foremost a lot of people forget that this is a job and our job is to entertain the fans whether they're booing you or cheering. He's doing that right now.
I've heard mixed reviews on the guy, I've never met him personally. I'm a judge of character after I meet people. I don't take anybody's opinion. Whatever beef Drew and Seth got with him that's on them. When I get back I'll figure out what kind of guy he is.
Every opportunity, especially now, considering the two of my brothers are gone, I think how special that time was. When I debuted on television I'd had five wrestling matches my entire career. So to have three seasoned wrestlers, veterans that have been around the world, second third generation wrestlers, the late great Luke Harper, one of the most unbelievable in ring technicians to ever do it.
Having those guys in my corner supporting me, helping me learn the trades, traveling around together, and really bonding, and becoming four brothers. It's special and it's unfortunate that life happens. And this is part of life and you remember the good times.
And now I have even more of a reason to come back and continue to carry on that legacy and represent Bray and Luke. So all my memories with the The Wyatt Family are very special.
The answer is going to be Bray Wyatt obviously for all the fun. We were together five days a week for eight years. We cried together, we laughed together, we missed our families together, we truly were brothers.
Be patient. That's all I could say. Be patient, know that I'm coming. I'm working hard as I ever can, I'm going to bring a total package back and get ready. Because when the monster kicks the door in and you see me back on television it's going to be a sight for the ages.

SPORTS,What crisis? Man United gets morale-boosting 2-1 win over Chelsea. City lose,https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/football/what-crisis-man-united-gets-morale-boosting-2-1-win-over-chelsea-city-lose-1-0-at-aston-villa-101701914361452.html,"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has spent the majority of the season in apparent crisis.
Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, spoke this week of his confidence that Manchester City would win an unprecedented fourth Premier League title in a row.
How quickly fortunes can change in football. Just three points now separate the rivals after United beat Chelsea 2-1 and the defending champions lost 1-0 at Aston Villa on Wednesday to extend their winless run in the league to four games.
“We are on a journey. We keep calm... We are going in the right direction,” Ten Hag said after he put a difficult few days behind him with a morale-boosting win.
The Dutch coach had gone into the game on the back of a 10th defeat of the season at Newcastle over the weekend and reports of player unrest in the locker room.
“(We) Don’t get distracted from criticism around us, but we are very critical of ourselves,” he said. “We know we are not satisfied and happy. We always want to do things better.”
Two goals from Scott McTominay secured the win and moved United up to sixth — three points off fourth-placed City.
Ten Hag will likely face much greater tests than a Chelsea team that is still struggling from the hangover of a chaotic first season under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. Not least against Bayern Munich next week, with a place in the Champions League knockout stage hanging by a thread.
But United’s manager would still welcome the change of mood around the club after such a troubled campaign, saying “we wanted to send this message to crowd.”
Now it is Guardiola who is facing tough questions as he was left to assess a winless run that saw City overtaken by Villa after Leon Bailey's 74th-minute winner.
City's previous three games in the league ended in draws, allowing leader Arsenal to extend a six-point lead over it in the standings after a 4-3 win against Luton on Tuesday.
“In these years we have found a way to win games, but we struggled a bit and we have to find a way,"" Guardiola said. “It is my job to find a solution. The dynamic changes by winning games.""
Villa's win saw it move up to third, two points ahead of last season's treble winners. Second-placed Liverpool trails Arsenal by two points after a 2-0 victory at Sheffield United.
Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool spoiled Chris Wilder's homecoming party at Sheffield United.
Wilder returned to the relegation-threatened club on Tuesday, having taken the team up to English soccer’s top division in 2019 and to a ninth-place finish in the 2019-20.
But he has a fight on his hands to avoid the drop. Goals from Virgil van Dijk and Dominik Szoboszlai consigned last-place Sheffield United to a 12th defeat of the season that leaves it four points from safety.
Nottingham Forest may be six points above the drop zone, but a 5-0 rout by Fulham has heaped the pressure on manager Steve Cooper.
Forest has lost five of its last six games in the league and only won one in its last 11.
Alex Iwobi and Raul Jimenez scored two each at Craven Cottage and Tom Cairney completed the rout that has increased speculation about Cooper's future.
Andoni Iraola is getting things right at Bournemouth. Having had to wait until October for a first win in the league, his team beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to make it three wins out of four in England's top flight.
Bournemouth is now up to 15th in the standings and nine points above the relegation zone.
Eighth-placed Brighton beat Brentford 2-1 to leave it five points off the top four.

SCIENCE,Apps using AI to undress women in photos gaining popularity: Report,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/apps-using-ai-to-undress-women-in-photos-gaining-popularity-report-101702087073728.html,"Apps and websites that use artificial intelligence to undress women in photos are soaring in popularity, according to researchers.
In September alone, 24 million people visited undressing websites, according to the social network analysis company Graphika.
Many of these undressing, or “nudify,” services use popular social networks for marketing, according to Graphika. For instance, since the beginning of this year, the number of links advertising undressing apps increased more than 2,400% on social media, including on X and Reddit, the researchers said. The services use AI to recreate an image so that the person is nude. Many of the services only work on women.
These apps are part of a worrying trend of non-consensual pornography being developed and distributed because of advances in artificial intelligence — a type of fabricated media known as deepfake pornography. Its proliferation runs into serious legal and ethical hurdles, as the images are often taken from social media and distributed without the consent, control or knowledge of the subject.
The rise in popularity corresponds to the release of several open source diffusion models, or artificial intelligence that can create images that are far superior to those created just a few years ago, Graphika said. Because they are open source, the models that the app developers use are available for free.
“You can create something that actually looks realistic,” said Santiago Lakatos, an analyst at Graphika, noting that previous deepfakes were often blurry.
One image posted to X advertising an undressing app used language that suggests customers could create nude images and then send them to the person whose image was digitally undressed, inciting harassment. One of the apps, meanwhile, has paid for sponsored content on Google’s YouTube, and appears first when searching with the word “nudify.”
A Google spokesperson said the company doesn’t allow ads “that contain sexually explicit content. We’ve reviewed the ads in question and are removing those that violate our policies.” Neither X nor Reddit responded to requests for comment.
In addition to the rise in traffic, the services, some of which charge $9.99 a month, claim on their websites that they are attracting a lot of customers. “They are doing a lot of business,” Lakatos said. Describing one of the undressing apps, he said, “If you take them at their word, their website advertises that it has more than a thousand users per day.”
Non-consensual pornography of public figures has long been a scourge of the internet, but privacy experts are growing concerned that advances in AI technology have made deepfake software easier and more effective.
“We are seeing more and more of this being done by ordinary people with ordinary targets,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “You see it among high school children and people who are in college.”
Many victims never find out about the images, but even those who do may struggle to get law enforcement to investigate or to find funds to pursue legal action, Galperin said.
There is currently no federal law banning the creation of deepfake pornography, though the US government does outlaw generation of these kinds of images of minors. In November, a North Carolina child psychiatrist was sentenced to 40 years in prison for using undressing apps on photos of his patients, the first prosecution of its kind under law banning deepfake generation of child sexual abuse material.
TikTok has blocked the keyword “undress,” a popular search term associated with the services, warning anyone searching for the word that it “may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines,” according to the app. A TikTok representative declined to elaborate. In response to questions, Meta Platforms Inc. also began blocking key words associated with searching for undressing apps. A spokesperson declined to comment.

SCIENCE,Aditya-L1 mission: ISRO activates second instrument on solar spacecraft,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adityal1-mission-isro-activates-second-instrument-on-solar-spacecraft-101701490344722.html,"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on Saturday said Aditya Solar Wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) payload onboard India's first solar satellite Aditya-L1, has commenced its operations and started working normally.
Sharing the post on X, the Indian space agency said, “The Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS), the second instrument in the Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) payload is operational.”

According to the space agency, ASPEX comprises two instruments – the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) and SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS). While the STEPS instrument started operating on September 10 while, the SWIS instrument was activated on November 2, 2023.
""SWIS, utilising two sensor units with a 360-degree field of view each, operates in planes perpendicular to one another. The instrument has successfully measured solar wind ions, primarily protons and alpha particles"", ISRO said in a statement.
The ISRO also shared a graph depicting the energy variations in proton (H+) and alpha particle (doubly ionized helium, He2) counts captured by SWIS over the past two days.
The variations were recorded with nominal integration time, providing a comprehensive snapshot of solar wind behaviour.
The space agency further said that the SWIS' directional capabilities allow for accurate measurements of solar wind alphas and protons, which significantly aids in answering long-standing concerns regarding the characteristics of the solar wind, its underlying processes, and its effects on Earth.
""The change in the proton and alpha particle number ratio, as observed by SWIS, holds the potential to provide indirect information about the arrival of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point L1,"" ISRO further said.
The enhanced alpha-to-proton ratio is considered important because it is regarded as one of the most sensitive indicators of the passage of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) at the L1 and thus, considered crucial for space weather studies.
Aditya-L1, India's first solar mission, was launched September 2 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Andhra Pradesh's Sriharikota. The mission aims to study the Sun from a halo orbit around first Sun-earth Lagrangian point (L1), which is located roughly 1.5 million km from Earth.

Know why,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/solar-storm-alert-nasa-predicts-radio-and-gps-blackout-on-november-30-know-why-101701152072158.html,"The gradual increase in space activities, especially solar storms, are monitored by space experts daily, who have now alerted that a solar storm is expected to hit the Earth on November 30, due to a coronal mass ejection.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has alerted that a solar storm is likely to hit Earth on November 30. This is being caused by a CME which hit the Earth on Sunday, causing a 15-hour long solar flare of the G2 class.
Space weather specialist Dr Tamitha Skov wrote on X that the sky will be lit up with auroras due to solar storms on November 30. Further, minor inconveniences can be faced by radio and GPS signals, which is normal during solar storms.


""The Sun aims south! A partly Earth-directed #solarstorm launched today. NASA & NOAA agree, a glancing blow is expected early November 30. This one is going mainly south of Earth so minor effects expected. #Aurora possible at high latitudes, #GPS & amateur #radio impacts minimal,"" the space weather expert wrote on X.
While the solar storm on Sunday was massive, the storm expected to occur on November 30 is expected to be on a much smaller scale. This is because majority of the flare is expected to pass by the Earth without even touching it.
Minor impacts of the solar storm, including a small blackout or disruption of radio and GPS signals near the poles is expected. Usually, a solar storm of a larger scale can cause internet blackout and electricity outage in several areas.
Solar storms, when they are of massive impact, can cause damage to communication systems. They can disrupt radio frequency and GPS signals, as well as cause internet outage. The effect usually only lasts for a couple of hours.
Meanwhile, solar storms are not usually harmful for humans. A solar flare of very high energy can cause radiational impacts on living organisms, but due to the Earth's atmosphere, the flares don't cause any harm to humans on the surface of the planet.

SCIENCE,New research reveals crucial insights on Antarctic ozone hole,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/new-research-reveals-crucial-insights-on-antarctic-ozone-hole-101700582903613.html,"The hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has been getting deeper in mid-spring over the last two decades, despite a global ban on chemicals that deplete Earth's shield from deadly solar radiation, new research suggested Tuesday.
The ozone layer 11 to 40 kilometres (seven to 25 miles) above Earth's surface filters out most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts.
From the mid-1970s, chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) -- once widely used in aerosols and refrigerators -- were found to be reducing ozone levels, creating annual holes largely over the Antarctica region.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol, which banned CFCs in a bid to close the hole, is considered a success story for international environmental cooperation.
In January, a major UN-backed assessment found that the agreement was working. It projected the ozone layer should be restored to 1980 levels over the Antarctic by around 2066.

Smaller holes over the Arctic were projected to recover by 2045, and for the rest of the world in around two decades.
But despite the decline in CFCs, there has not yet been a significant reduction in the area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole, according to New Zealand researchers behind a new study in the journal Nature Communications.
And there has been less ozone at the centre of the hole over time, they added.
""Six of the last nine years have had really low ozone amounts and extremely large ozone holes,"" study co-author Annika Seppala of New Zealand's Otago University told AFP.
""What might be happening is something else is going on in the atmosphere now -- possibly because of climate change -- and that's masking some of the recovery,"" she said.
The ozone hole over Antarctica usually opens in September and lasts until November, taking in the Southern Hemisphere's spring.
The researchers said the hole has been opening later in September, indicating a recovery possibly due to CFC reductions.
But in October, when the hole is often largest, the ozone level in the middle stratospheric layer shrunk by 26 percent from 2004 to 2022, said the study, citing satellite data.
The study's lead author Hannah Kessenich emphasised that the Montreal Protocol and CFC reductions were still ""on track"".
But ""altogether, our findings reveal the recent, large ozone holes may not be caused just by CFCs,"" she added.
The analysis excluded data from the years 2002 and 2019, when ""sudden break-ups of the polar vortex"" led to significantly smaller ozone holes, Kessenich added.
Leading ozone scientist Susan Solomon, who was not involved in the research, told AFP that the study should be viewed through the lens that ""the past few years have been quite unusual"".
Solomon led previous research showing that 2020's ozone hole was made 10 percent wider by the massive ""Black Saturday"" wildfires in Australia.
The gigantic eruption of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano off Tonga in 2022 is also believed to have affected recent ozone levels.
Martin Jucker, an expert at Australia's University of New South Wales, was not convinced by the study's results.
""It is questionable how the authors can remove 2002 and 2019 from the record but not 2020-22, given that all of these years have been shown to be dominated by very special and rare events,"" he said.

The study came amid reports of sudden deaths of young adults including popular Malayalam TV actor Dr Priya after suffering from a sudden cardiac arrest. Similar reports of sudden deaths among healthy adults in India raised concerns that they might be related to Covid-19 or the vaccination against the disease, which prompted researchers to carry out the study.
The ICMR study titled ‘Factors associated with sudden deaths among adults aged 18-45 years in India -- a multicentric matched case-control study’ referred to certain factors that may increase the risk of sudden deaths. Among the causes, history of severe Covid-19 infection, binge drinking, use of recreational drugs or substances are responsible for deaths within 48 hours. The study, which was completed earlier this month, is yet to be released.
The study included cases of apparently healthy individuals aged 18-45 years with no underlying health issues who died suddenly from unexplained causes between October 1, 2021 and March 31, 2023.
Earlir, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya cited the ICMR study and said that those who had earlier suffered a severe bout of Covid must not overexert themselves for a year or two to avoid heart attacks and cardiac arrests.

SCIENCE,Earth core's mysterious new layer formed due to surface water diving deep: Study,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/earth-cores-mysterious-new-layer-formed-due-to-surface-water-diving-deep-study-101700488178379.html,"The formation of new enigmatic layer – E prime layer – at the outermost part of Earth's core is a result of ""surface water penetrating deep into the planet,"" altering the composition of the metallic liquid core's outermost region, a study by an international team of researchers, including those from Arizona State University (ASU) revealed.
Earth comprises four primary layers: an inner core at the planet's center, surrounded by the outer core, mantle, and crust.
Citing a published paper from Nature Geoscience, an ASU researcher said that for years it was believed that a material exchange between the core and mantle is small. But the experiments revealed that when water reaches the core-mantle boundary, it reacts with silicon in the core, forming silica.
-This latest research suggests that tectonic plates carrying surface water have transported it deep into the Earth over billions of years. Upon reaching the core-mantle boundary about 1,800 miles below the surface, this water initiates significant chemical changes, influencing the core's structure.
-Scientists at ASU along with Yong Jae Lee from Yonsei University in South Korea, have observed that subducted water reacts chemically with core materials under high pressure.
-This reaction leads to the formation of a hydrogen-rich, silicon-depleted layer at the outer core, resembling a film-like structure.


-Silica crystals generated by this process ascend and blend into the mantle, impacting the overall composition.
-These modifications in the liquid metallic layer could potentially result in reduced density and altered seismic characteristics, aligning with anomalies detected by seismologists.
The researchers further said that this discovery enhances our comprehension of Earth's internal mechanisms, indicating a broader and more intricate global water cycle than previously acknowledged. The transformed layer in the core holds significant implications for the interconnected geochemical processes linking surface water cycles with the deep metallic core.
An international group of geoscientists conducted this research, employing sophisticated experimental methods at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Lab and PETRA III of Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Germany. These techniques aimed to recreate the extreme conditions observed at the core-mantle boundary.

SCIENCE,Microbiome treatments are taking off,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/microbiome-treatments-are-taking-off-101700329466778.html,"In a small laboratory at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, Désirée Prossomariti is processing donations. Each is weighed, tested for pathogens, filtered, centrifuged and then freeze-dried, before being turned into a powder to be encapsulated and given to patients. The process takes a strong stomach, for the donations are of fresh faecal matter. “I don’t smell it any more,” says Dr Prossomariti.

The lab workers are not interested in the faeces themselves, but the tiny organisms they carry. Scientists have long known that the guts of animals, including humans, are full of bacteria, viruses and other micro-organisms. But it is only recently that they have come to understand just how important they are. Far from a collection of mere passengers, the microbiome is a vital part of a healthy body. Its members help break down food, produce chemicals that regulate the body within which they live, and repress the growth of other, harmful species of bacteria.
It is one of those harmful bacterial species that Dr Prossomariti’s pills are designed to repress, through a process known as a “faecal microbiota transplantation” (FMT). Five pills (or “crapsules”, as the lab workers like to call them) can overcome a recurrent infection of Clostridium difficile, a bacterium which has evolved resistance to many antibiotics. As its name suggests, the idea is to copy a healthy person’s gut ecosystem and reproduce it in someone whose microbiome is out-of-kilter.
It works, too. FMT is a standard remedy for C. difficile infections in Britain and is being investigated for diseases from irritable bowel syndrome to multiple sclerosis. But FMT is only the beginning of the microbial-medicine revolution. Researchers believe that, rather than the relatively blunt approach of copying over a microbiome in toto, the future lies in tweaking microbiomes to meet a specific patient’s needs. FMT is a stopgap, says Eric Pamer, a microbiologist at the University of Chicago.
Besides the “yuck” factor—which, say researchers, tends to evaporate when patients are presented with the evidence—FMT suffers from several problems. Those who donate the stool find the process off-putting. The stool itself is impossible to standardise, varying across donors and even across donations.
That makes it hard to regulate consistently. America and Canada regard FMT pills as investigational drugs. In Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium, FMT is viewed as a tissue transplant. Britain, meanwhile, considers it a medicinal product, which allows for more flexible regulation.
All this strongly limits supply. Simon Goldenberg, who runs the laboratory where Dr Prossomariti works, reckons that of a thousand patients with recurrent C. difficile infections in Britain each year, only a few hundred get the treatment. There is also an open question as to whether chronic conditions could ever be reliably treated with FMT. Even if the entire microbiome is replaced, says Bernd Schnabl, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Diego, the benefits will be temporary if the root cause is untreated.
Hence the push for finer-tuned treatments. Rather than tweaking the populations of individual species of bacteria in a patient’s microbiome, for instance, Dr Schnabl is focused on the metabolites that they produce. Take ammonia, which is linked to cirrhosis of the liver. One approach to limiting its presence in the gut (and, subsequently, the bloodstream) is to genetically engineer neighbouring bacteria to be better ammonia-eaters. Another is to grow bacteria-killing viruses, known as phages, which can reduce the number of ammonia-producing microbes. Dr Schnabl hopes to begin a trial of such phages for alcohol-related hepatitis next year.
Trials with bacteria, meanwhile, are hampered by a shortage of bacteria produced to sufficiently high safety standards. Dr Pamer is therefore developing manufacturing methods that meet the stringent regulations—known as Good Manufacturing Practice—that apply to substances used in clinical trials. Dr Pamer hopes his facility, which can churn out bacteria in 50-litre batches, will receive its certification by the end of the month. If it gets it, says Dr Pamer, then to the best of his knowledge that would make it the first academic site capable of producing enough high-quality bacteria to supply trials. He hopes to run clinical trials on microbiome manipulation for liver disease early next year.
The industry is interested, too. Seres Therapeutics is a biotech firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its philosophy involves designing communities of bacteria that, when parachuted into the hostile environment of a malfunctioning gut, can restore order. Matthew Henn, the firm’s chief scientific officer, says the idea is to use the bacteria themselves as a drug; one that has an evolved ability to get to where it needs to go, and whose diversity of constituent species endows it with many possible simultaneous effects.
In April, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an American regulator, approved a product called SER-109—the first oral microbiome therapeutic—for use against recurrent C. difficile infections. The company is now testing a cluster of 16 bacteria they call SER-155 in patients who have undergone an allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplant, a treatment for diseases such as leukaemia in which bone-marrow stem cells are transplanted in order to strengthen the patient’s immune system. This process, which often includes high antibiotic doses, can severely damage the microbiome, making a dangerous infection harder to fight off.
Early results released in May showed that the treatment was well-tolerated and that, over 30 days, only one new infection occurred in nine patients given SER-155, compared with six that might have been expected without treatment. Additional results from a placebo-controlled trial are expected in late 2024.
The team at Seres have identified other types of immunocompromised patients that are susceptible to bacterial infections and hope to begin other trials soon. And they have competition, too. Vedanta Biosciences is another biotech company also based in Cambridge. Earlier this year VE303, a product it produces that contains a mixture of eight strains of harmless C. difficile relatives, did well in clinical trials on 79 individuals with recurrent infections of the hostile version of the bacterium. After eight weeks, subjects who had taken high doses of the treatment were less likely to get a recurrent C. difficile infection than those on the placebo. The company has “fast track” designation from the FDA, and hopes to begin a larger trial soon.
It is early days, in other words, but the prospects for a new era of microbiome medicine, more sophisticated than crude-but-effective FMTs, look promising. “Our drugs are just that,” says Dr Henn, at Seres. “They are the next generation.”

SCIENCE,Even doctors can struggle to diagnose concussions,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/even-doctors-can-struggle-to-diagnose-concussions-101700329547829.html,"On June 23rd a court case brought by more than 200 rugby-union players kicked off in London. The players claim the sport’s administrators failed in the past to protect them from repeated concussions and blows to the head that, they say, have left them with lifelong brain injuries and early-onset dementia.

Concussions and other forms of brain injury have become one of the biggest worries in sports from soccer to ice hockey. In America, the National Football League, which governs American football, has had to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to brain-damaged players.
Rugby’s current administrators are scrambling to change things. Authorities in France, England and New Zealand have changed the rules to lower the legal height of tackles, in the hope that will prevent at least some head impacts. New rules released in April mean that a player with a suspected concussion must be removed from the pitch immediately.
One of the problems, though, is properly diagnosing concussion in the first place. Currently, this is an unreliable art. Pitch-side doctors must rely on a mix of outward clinical signs and self-reported symptoms, which players keen to return to the fray may underplay. Away from professionally organised sports, where people take spills or butt heads without medical supervision, it is even harder to decide whether damage has been done.
Doctors are trying to help. In May the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine published a new set of diagnostic criteria, under which a patient without clear external signs—such as confusion or unconsciousness—would have to report at least two symptoms, such as feeling confused or dizzy, for a concussion to be suspected. But a new development, pioneered by Adam Shuhendler, a biochemist at the University of Ottawa, may bring more rigour. Earlier this month, at the Canadian Chemistry Conference in Vancouver, he laid out how a reliable clinical test for concussion might work.
Dr Shuhendler’s speciality is creating dyes that bind to specific molecules in the body. In this case, the molecules he has in mind are a class of chemicals called aldehydes. Though these are thought to function as messengers between many different cells in the body, they seem to be produced in greater quantities in response to cellular stress—including from injury. Perhaps, he thought, the same thing would happen in the brain as well.
Once Dr Shuhendler and his team had developed a dye, they created concussions in a dish, by squeezing a chunk of lab-grown neurons. They applied the dye and waited for it to make aldehydes visible—which, sure enough, it did. The next step was to check if they could spot concussions in mice. That required concussed mice, which the researchers produced with a device that impacted the animals’ heads with enough force to disorient them for a few seconds, but without causing serious damage. To make the experience better they gave them painkillers—but they did not sedate them, because a sleeping brain is known to react differently to shocks. They then injected the mice with the dye and put them in miniature magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, which revealed the dye-marked aldehydes.
Transferring the technology to humans may take some time. For one thing, the safety of the dye has yet to be proved in people. Dr Shuhendler thinks one option might be to try the dye with positron emission tomography (PET) scans rather than MRIs. Though they tend to be more expensive, PET tests are also much more sensitive and therefore require only trace amounts of dye. That should make getting approval easier.
Eventually, it might even be possible to do the diagnosis with a simple blood test. In the meantime, though, a hospital test that offered a definitive diagnosis of concussion would still be useful, because so many are missed by doctors. One paper, published in 2018, noted that health statistics suggest around 22m people around the world suffer a mild brain injury every year. When the researchers tried to correct for undercounting, they arrived at a figure of 55m. But that is still merely an informed guess. It would be useful to be sure.

SCIENCE,"SpaceX Starship set for repeat test flight, seven months after last one blew up",https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/spacex-starship-set-for-repeat-test-flight-seven-months-after-last-one-blew-up-101700303268996.html,"SpaceX's next-generation spacecraft Starship, developed to carry astronauts to the moon and beyond, was set for blastoff on Saturday for a repeat test launch from south Texas, seven months after its first attempt to reach space ended with an explosion.
The uncrewed launch was scheduled to take place during a 20-minute window beginning at 7 am CST (1300 GMT) at SpaceX's Starbase site on the Gulf of Mexico near Boca Chica. Starship is mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster in what will be the second attempted flight of both vehicles together.
The mission's objective is to get Starship off the ground in Texas and into space just shy of reaching orbit, then plunge through Earth's atmosphere for a splashdown off Hawaii's coast. The launch had been scheduled for Friday but was pushed back by a day for a last-minute swap of flight-control hardware.
A successful test flight would mark a key step toward achieving SpaceX's ambition of producing a large, multi-purpose, spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo back to the moon later this decade for NASA, and ultimately to Mars.

Elon Musk - SpaceX's founder, chief executive and chief engineer - also sees Starship as eventually replacing the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket as the centerpiece of its launch business that already lofts most of the world's satellites and other commercial payloads into space.
NASA, SpaceX's primary customer, has a considerable stake in the success of Starship, which the U.S. space agency is counting on to play a central role in its human spaceflight program, Artemis, successor to the Apollo missions of more than a half century ago that put astronauts on the moon for the first time.
Starship's towering first-stage booster, propelled by 33 Raptor engines, puts the rocket system's full height at some 400 feet (122 meters) and produces thrust twice as powerful as the Saturn V rocket that sent the Apollo astronauts to the moon.
SpaceX is aiming to at least exceed Starship-Super Heavy's performance during its April 20 test flight, when the two-stage spacecraft blew itself to bits less than four minutes into a planned 90-minute flight.
That flight went awry from the start. SpaceX has acknowledged that some of the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines malfunctioned on ascent, and that the lower-stage booster rocket failed to separate as designed from the upper-stage Starship before the flight was terminated.
The company's engineering culture, considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry's more established players, is built on a flight-testing strategy that pushes spacecraft to the point of failure, then fine-tunes improvements through frequent repetition.
A failure at any point in the test flight would be a major concern for NASA, which is counting on SpaceX's rapid rocket development ethos to swiftly get humans to the moon in the US competition with China's lunar ambitions.
Judging the success or failure of the outcome may be less than clear-cut, depending on how far the spacecraft gets this time. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, who has made the China rivalry a key need for speed, compared Starship's test campaign with the success of SpaceX's past rocket development efforts.
""How did they develop the Falcon 9? They went through many tests, sometimes it blew up,"" Nelson told Reuters on Tuesday. ""They'd find out what went wrong, they'd correct it then go back.""
The combined spacecraft in April reached a peak altitude of roughly 25 miles (40 km), only about halfway to space at its target altitude of 90 miles (150 km), before bursting into flames.
Musk has said that an internal fire during Starship's ascent damaged its engines and computers, causing it to stray off course, and that an automatic-destruct command was activated some 40 seconds later than it should have to blow up the rocket.
The launch pad itself was shattered by the force of the blastoff, which also sparked a 3.5-acre (1.4-hectare) brush fire. No one was injured. SpaceX has since reinforced the launch pad with a massive water-cooled steel plate, one of dozens of corrective actions that the US Federal Aviation Administration required before granting a launch license on Wednesday for the second test flight.

SCIENCE,NASA to observe asteroid as wide as Empire State Building near-Earth encounter,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/nasa-probe-to-observe-asteroid-as-wide-as-empire-state-building-near-earth-encounter-101699614940433.html,"About 5-1/2 years from now, astronomers predict, an asteroid about as wide as the Empire State Building is tall will streak through space within 20,000 miles (32,200 km) of Earth, the closest any celestial object of that size will have come to our planet in modern history.
When it does, a spacecraft launched by NASA in 2016 is expected to be in position to provide a detailed examination of this rare close encounter.
The mission, directed by University of Arizona scientists, is expected to yield insights into planetary formation and knowledge that could inform efforts to build a defense system against possible doomsday asteroid collisions with Earth.
At the time of its 2004 discovery, the asteroid Apophis, named for a demon serpent embodying evil and chaos in ancient Egyptian mythology, appeared to pose a dire impact threat to Earth, with scientists forecasting a potential collision in 2029. Refined observations have since ruled out any impact risk for at least another century.
Still, its next approach in 2029 will bring the asteroid within a cosmic cat's whisker of Earth - less than one-tenth the moon's distance from us and well within the orbits of some geosynchronous Earth satellites.
The spacecraft now headed for a rendezvous with Apophis is OSIRIS-REx, which made headlines plucking a soil sample from a different asteroid three years ago and sending it back to Earth in a capsule that made a parachute landing in Utah in September.
Rather than retire the spacecraft, NASA has rebranded it as OSIRIS-APEX - short for APophis EXplorer - and fired its thrusters to put it on course for its next target.
The Apophis expedition was detailed in a mission overview published in the Planetary Science Journal.
Apophis, oblong and somewhat peanut-shaped, is a stony asteroid believed to consist mostly of silicate materials along with iron and nickel. Measuring about 1,110 feet (340 meters) across, it is due to pass within about 19,800 miles (31,860 km) of Earth's surface on April 13, 2029, becoming visible to the naked eye for a few hours, said Michael Nolan, deputy principal investigator for the mission at the University of Arizona.
""It's not going to be this glorious show,"" Nolan said, but it will appear as a point of reflected sunlight in the night sky over Africa and Europe.
An asteroid that large passing so near to Earth is estimated to occur roughly once every 7,500 years. The Apophis flyby is the first such encounter predicted in advance.
The tidal pull of Earth's gravity likely will cause measurable disturbances to the asteroid's surface and motion, changing its orbital path and rotational spin. Tidal forces could trigger landslides on Apophis and dislodge rocks and dust particles to create a comet-like tail.
The spacecraft is set to observe the asteroid's Earth flyby as it nears and ultimately catches up with Apophis. These images and data would be combined with ground-based telescope measurements to detect and quantify how Apophis was altered as it passed by Earth.
OSIRIS-APEX is scheduled to remain near Apophis for 18 months - orbiting, maneuvering around it and even hovering just over its surface, using rocket thrusters to kick up loose material and reveal what lies beneath.
Like other asteroids, Apophis is a relic of the early solar system. Its mineralogy and chemistry are largely unchanged in more than 4.5 billion years, offering clues to the origin and development of rocky planets like Earth.
Close examination of Apophis could give planetary defense experts valuable information about the structure and other properties of asteroids. The more scientists know about the composition, density and orbital behavior of such celestial ""rubble piles,"" the greater the chances of devising effective asteroid-deflection strategies to mitigate impact threats.
NASA deliberately crashed a spacecraft into a small asteroid last year in a planetary-defense test that nudged the rocky object from its normal path, marking the first time humankind altered the natural motion of a celestial body.
Apophis is substantially larger than that asteroid but tiny compared with the one that struck Earth 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs.
While not big enough to pose an existential threat to life on Earth, an Apophis-sized asteroid striking the planet at hypersonic speed still could devastate a major city or region, Nolan said, with ocean impact unleashing tsunamis.
""It wouldn't be globally catastrophic in the sense of mass extinctions,"" but an impact ""would definitely come under the category of bad,"" Nolan said.
""This thing is coming in at many miles per second if it hits. And at that speed, it kind of doesn't whether if it's made of gravel or ice or rocks or whatever. It's just a big, heavy thing moving fast,"" Nolan added.

SCIENCE,Scientists detect oxygen in atmosphere of Venus,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/scientists-detect-oxygen-in-atmosphere-of-venus-101699520611376.html,"Oxygen accounts for about 21% of Earth's air, with the rest of our atmosphere primarily nitrogen. And most living things - including people, as we well know - need oxygen to survive.
Earth's planetary neighbor Venus offers quite a different story. Its thick and noxious atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide - 96.5% - with lesser amounts of nitrogen and trace gases. Oxygen is nearly absent. In fact, with Venus getting far less scientific attention than other planets such as Mars, the direct detection of its oxygen has remained difficult.
Using an instrument aboard the SOFIA airborne observatory - a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to carry an infrared telescope in a joint project between NASA and the German Aerospace Center - scientists have now detected atomic oxygen in a thin layer sandwiched between two other layers of the Venusian atmosphere.
They noted that this atomic oxygen, which consists of a single oxygen atom, differs from molecular oxygen, which consists of two oxygen atoms and is breathable.
The researchers directly detected oxygen for the first time on the side of Venus facing the sun - where it actually is produced in the atmosphere - as well as detecting it on the side facing away from the sun, where it previously was spotted by a ground-based telescope in Hawaii. Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth.
""The Venus atmosphere is very dense. The composition is also very different from Earth,"" said German Aerospace Center physicist Heinz-Wilhelm Hübers, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.
The thick atmosphere on the second planet from the sun traps in heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
""Venus is not hospitable, at least for organisms we know from Earth,"" Hübers added.
The oxygen is produced on the planet's day side by ultraviolet radiation from the sun that breaks down atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into oxygen atoms and other chemicals, the researchers said. Some of the oxygen is then transported by winds to the Venusian night side.
""This detection of atomic oxygen on Venus is direct proof for the action of photochemistry - triggered by solar UV radiation - and for the transport of its products by the winds of Venus' atmosphere,"" said astrophysicist and study co-author Helmut Wiesemeyer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany.
""On Earth, our life-protecting stratospheric ozone layer represents a well-known example of such photochemistry,"" Wiesemeyer added.
On Venus, there is a layer of clouds containing sulfuric acid up to a height of about 40 miles (65 km) above the planetary surface, with hurricane-force winds blowing in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. About 75 miles (120 km) above the surface, strong winds blow in the same direction as the planet's rotation.
The oxygen was found to be concentrated between those two ferocious layers, at an altitude about 60 miles (100 km). The oxygen's temperature was found to range from about minus 184 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 120 degrees Celsius) on the planet's day side to minus 256 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 degrees Celsius) on its night side.
Methods used previously to detect Venusian oxygen on the day side were indirect, based on measurements of other molecules in combination with photochemical models.
Venus, with a diameter of about 7,500 miles (12,000 km), is slightly smaller than Earth. In our solar system, Earth resides comfortably within the ""habitable zone"" around the sun - the distance considered not too close and not too far from a star to be able to host life, with Venus near the inner boundary and Mars close to the outer edge.
""We are still at the beginning of understanding the evolution of Venus and why it is so different from Earth,"" Hübers said.

SCIENCE,How can IIT Kanpur's ‘artificial rain’ help curb Delhi pollution issue?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-iit-kanpurs-artificial-rain-help-curb-delhi-pollution-issue-explained-101699436927030.html,"Over the past few days, the pollution in Delhi has been worsening, causing significant problems for its residents and shrouding other parts of northern India, including cities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and more, in a toxic haze. As of 5 pm on Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi stood at a 'very poor' level of 398.
To address this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has proposed the idea of ""artificial rain"" to reduce pollution levels in the national capital. This project has been in development since 2018, and the institute conducted trials in July of this year, as reported by the Economic Times. The researchers have secured the necessary permissions from government authorities, including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), to carry out cloud seeding for this purpose.
Manindra Agrawal, a professor in the computer science and engineering department at IIT Kanpur and the driving force behind this project, explained that artificial rain could provide temporary relief for up to a week to residents in the National Capital Region (NCR) suffering from poor air quality, according to the ET report.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) classifies its actions into four stages: Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450).
Cloud seeding is an artificial method used to increase rainfall by introducing certain substances into clouds that serves various purposes, including reducing the impact of droughts, preventing forest fires, increasing precipitation, and enhancing air quality.
During cloud seeding, chemicals like silver iodide, potassium iodide, and dry ice are released into the sky using airplanes and helicopters. These chemicals attract water vapour, leading to the formation of rain clouds. It usually takes about half an hour for this method to make it rain.
According to the ScienceDirect, cloud seeding techniques can be divided into two categories. Hygroscopic cloud seeding aims to accelerate the coalescence of droplets in liquid clouds, resulting in the formation of larger droplets that lead to precipitation. In this method, salt particles are typically dispersed at the cloud's base. The other technique, glaciogenic cloud seeding, focuses on inducing ice production in supercooled clouds, leading to precipitation. Glaciogenic cloud seeding involves dispersing efficient ice nuclei, such as silver iodide particles or dry ice, into the cloud, which triggers heterogeneous ice nucleation.
This process also requires obtaining several approvals, including those from the DGCA, the ministry of home affairs (MHA), and the Special Protection Group responsible for the prime minister's security, to allow aircraft to fly over the national capital, which is in dire need of cleaner air. Moreover, the success of the artificial rain depends on specific meteorological conditions, such as the presence of moisture-laden clouds and suitable wind patterns.
In September, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai, mentioned that the city government was gearing up to carry out cloud seeding as part of its winter action plan to combat air pollution.

SCIENCE,Euclid telescope sends back first images of cosmos from ‘dark universe’ mission,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/euclid-space-telescope-sends-back-first-colour-images-of-cosmos-from-dark-universe-mission-101699371247095.html,"The first images sent back by the Euclid space telescope from its “dark universe” mission have been revealed. On Tuesday, November 7, astronomers hailed the powerful space telescope, which captured detailed colour images of the cosmos. The Euclid telescope's initial release includes five space observations made from its orbital home, 1 million miles or 1.5 million km away from the Earth. Before unveiling the pictures Euclid project scientist René Laureijs said, “We have never seen astronomical images like this before, containing so much detail.”
“They are even more beautiful and sharp than we could have hoped for, showing us many previously unseen features in well-known areas of the nearby universe,” Laureijs added. Back in July, the European Space Agency first launched the Euclid telescope, calling it their “dark universe detective.” According to the ESA, Euclid will observe the shapes, distances, and motions of billions of galaxies spanning over 10 billion light-years over the next six years. This will lead to the creation of the largest cosmic 3D map ever made with the primary goal of observing dark matter and dark energy in the cosmos.


ESA's director of science Carole Mundell said before revealing the high-quality pictures, “I'm absolutely delighted to say that is the point where we say that we have reached all of our engineering milestones for the mission and we're now able to move into the science phase.” In a never-seen-before series of pictures, the striking Perseus Cluster and its 1,000 galaxies, along with its 100,000 additional distant galaxies in the background can be seen in an unfathomable detail. The space telescope also observed spiral galaxy IC 342 a.k.a “The Hidden Galaxy.”

According to a statement released by Matthias Kluge, a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching and the Ludwig Maximilian University, “With Euclid’s huge field of view and its high sensitivity, the galaxies in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster can be measured down to their outermost and faintest regions. Together with the numerous globular clusters that we discover in the razor-sharp images, we thus gain new insights into the late stages of galaxy evolution, when galaxies collide and merge,” as per CNN.

SCIENCE,How adult brains learn the new without forgetting the old,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/how-adult-brains-learn-the-new-without-forgetting-the-old-101699110228872.html,"This article is part of our Summer reads series. Visit the full collection for book lists, guest essays and more seasonal distractions.

Learning new things is hard. Remembering what has already been learned is harder. Any successful learning system, be it a brain or a piece of artificial intelligence software, must strike the right balance between stability and flexibility. It must be stable enough to remember important old things yet flexible enough to learn new ones without destroying old memory traces—preferably for as long as they exist.
Learning is a result of changes in the pattern of neural connectivity in the brain. Each connection between nerve cells, called a synapse, is a tiny gap between the ends of branches ramifying from such cells. Messages jump across these gaps in the form of molecules called neurotransmitters. Current estimates suggest there are 600 trillion synapses in the human brain.
How, then, to deal with the stability-plasticity dilemma—particularly as brains age and, as it were, fill up? Research by Dimitra Vardalaki, Kwanghun Chung and Mark Harnett at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, just published in Nature, suggests one way is to preserve into adulthood a type of memory-forming synapse found in children. These are called silent synapses.
Silent synapses—which, as their name suggests, transmit no signal from one nerve cell to another—are often found on the ends of slender, immature protrusions from nerve cells, called filopodia. Until now, it had been thought that these disappeared as a brain matured. But Drs Vardalaki, Chung and Harnett have shown not only that they are present in adulthood, but also that they are common, at least in mice. Just over a quarter of the connections they sampled in adult mouse visual cortices were silent synapses on filopodia. And murine and human brains are sufficiently alike that something similar almost certainly applies to people.
To carry out their search for filopodia, the trio used a sensitive microscopy technique called eMAP. They studied 2,234 synapses between cortical nerve cells of a type called pyramidal neurons (pictured), which have thousands of synapses each. Peering through an eMAP microscope is enough to determine which cellular protrusions are filopodia. But it cannot show which synapses on them are silent.
To do that, they needed to test how the filopodia responded to glutamate, the brain’s main excitatory neurotransmitter. First, they had to deliver a controlled flow of glutamate to the particular synapse they wanted to test. To this end, they poured a soup of “caged” glutamate over the neuron under examination. This form of the molecule is inert until hit with energy from the intersection of two laser beams.
Aiming those at the synapse under study enabled them to uncage the neurotransmitter and see, by measuring the electrical activity in that part of the neuron using an ultrafine electrode, whether the synapse responded. They found that mature pyramidal-neuron protrusions generated electrical activity when exposed to glutamate, as expected. Filopodia did not, confirming the silence of their synapses.
Silent synapses are, however, useless unless they can be switched on at the appropriate moment. And the researchers confirmed this is possible. They were able to induce the silent versions on filopodia to turn into mature, active synapses by pairing the simulated release of glutamate with a subsequent surge of electricity inside the neuron.
This pairing of events caused silent synapses to start, within minutes, displaying receptor molecules characteristic of active synapses. The same pairing, applied to mature synapses, did nothing. The researchers thereby show it is hard to get a mature synapse to change the strength of its connection (thus satisfying the stability side of the dilemma), but easy to unsilence a silent one (satisfying the plasticity side).
The next thing to investigate is how, why and when new filopodia appear. The discovery of all these eager-to-learn silent synapses and filopodia, Dr Harnett says, “is a lever for us to get into understanding learning in adults and how potentially we can get access to make it not degrade over the course of ageing or disease”.

SCIENCE,Wearable devices can now prevent astronauts from being 'lost' in space,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/wearable-devices-can-now-prevent-astronauts-from-being-lost-in-space-101699105990581.html,"Although the sky is no longer the limit, flying is dangerous. When we leave the Earth's surface, we lose many of the signs we need to orient ourselves, and this spatial disorientation can be fatal.
To defend themselves against it, astronauts often require significant training. Wearable gadgets that vibrate to provide orientation cues, however, have been identified by scientists to significantly improve the efficacy of this training, making spaceflight marginally safer.
""Long duration spaceflight will cause many physiological and psychological stressors, which will make astronauts very susceptible to spatial disorientation,"" said Dr Vivekanand P. Vimal of Brandeis University in the United States, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Physiology. ""When disoriented, an astronaut will no longer be able to rely on their own internal sensors which they have depended on for their whole lives.""
The researchers used sensory deprivation and a multi-axis rotation device to test their vibrotactors in simulated spaceflight, so the senses participants would normally rely on were useless. Could the vibrotactors correct the misleading cues the participants would receive from their vestibular systems, and could participants be trained to trust them?
Weird Science | A hop for a lander, a leap for ISRO, a giant stride in knowledge
30 participants were recruited, of which 10 received training to balance in the rotation device, 10 received the vibrotactors, and the remaining 10 received both. All participants were shown a video of the rotation device and told how it worked: moving like an inverted pendulum until it reached a crash boundary unless it was stabilized by a person sitting in the device controlling it with a joystick.
Additional training, for the participants who received it, included tasks that taught participants to disengage from their vestibular sense and rely on the vibrotactors instead of their natural gravitational cues. These tasks involved searching for hidden non-upright balance points, which meant participants had to ignore their desire to align upright and focus on the vibrotactors.
All participants were given a blindfold, earplugs, and white noise to listen to. Those with vibrotactors had four strapped to each arm, which would buzz when they moved away from the balance point. Each participant took part in 40 trials, aiming to keep the rotation device as close to the balance point as possible.

For half the trials, the rotation device operated on a vertical roll plane. This was considered an Earth analog because participants could use their natural gravitational cues for orientation. During the second half, which acted as a spaceflight analog, the rotation device operated on a horizontal roll plane where those gravitational cues could no longer help.
After each block of trials, participants were asked to rate how disoriented they felt and how much they trusted the vibrotactors. The scientists measured their success by looking at how often they crashed and how well they controlled their balance.
To infinity and beyond
All the groups were initially disoriented in the spaceflight analog. The scientists expected this, because participants could not rely on the natural gravitational cues that they usually use. Nearly all participants reported that they trusted the vibrotactors, but they also reported confusion from conflicts between their internal cues and the vibrotactors.
The participants wearing vibrotactors still performed better than those who only received training. The training-only group crashed more frequently, moved around the balance point more, and accidentally destabilized themselves more often. Receiving the training did help, though. As the trials continued, the group who received both training and vibrotactors performed best.
However, even with training, the participants didn't perform as well as they did in the Earth analog. They may have needed more time to integrate cues from the vibrotactors, or the buzzing from the vibrotactors may not have given a strong enough danger signal.
""A pilot's cognitive trust in this external device will most likely not be enough,"" said Vimal. ""Instead, the trust has to be at a deeper, almost sub-cognitive, level. To achieve this, specialized training will be required.""
If the sensors succeed in more extensive trials, the scientists said, the possible applications for spaceflight are many -- from helping astronauts land safely on the surface of a planet, to supporting them as they move outside a vehicle in space.

It turns out that the asteroid Dinkinesh has a dinky sidekick — a mini moon.
The discovery was made during Wednesday’s flyby of Dinkinesh, 300 million miles (480 million kilometers) away in the main asteroid belt beyond Mars. The spacecraft snapped a picture of the pair when it was about 270 miles out (435 kilometers).
In data and images beamed back to Earth, the spacecraft confirmed that Dinkinesh is barely a half-mile (790 meters) across. Its closely circling moon is a mere one-tenth-of-a-mile (220 meters) in size.

NASA sent Lucy past Dinkinesh as a rehearsal for the bigger, more mysterious asteroids out near Jupiter. Launched in 2021, the spacecraft will reach the first of these so-called Trojan asteroids in 2027 and explore them for at least six years. The original target list of seven asteroids now stands at 11.
Dinkinesh means “you are marvelous” in the Amharic language of Ethiopia. It's also the Amharic name for Lucy, the 3.2 million-year-old remains of a human ancestor found in Ethiopia in the 1970s, for which the spacecraft is named.
“Dinkinesh really did live up to its name; this is marvelous,” Southwest Research Institute's Hal Levison, the lead scientist, said in a statement.

SCIENCE,Asteroid dust caused 15-year winter that killed dinosaurs: Study,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/asteroid-dust-caused-15-year-winter-that-killed-dinosaurs-study-101698688124513.html,"Around 66 million years ago, an asteroid bigger than Mount Everest smashed into Earth, killing off three quarters of all life on the planet -- including the dinosaurs.
This much we know.
But exactly how the impact of the asteroid Chicxulub caused all those animals to go extinct has remained a matter of debate.
The leading theory recently has been that sulphur from the asteroid's impact -- or soot from global wildfires it sparked -- blocked out the sky and plunged the world into a long, dark winter, killing all but the lucky few.
However research published Monday based on particles found at a key fossil site reasserted an earlier hypothesis: that the impact winter was caused by dust kicked up by the asteroid.
Fine silicate dust from pulverised rock would have stayed in the atmosphere for 15 years, dropping global temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celsius, researchers said in a study in the journal Nature Geoscience.
READ | Rare 150 million-year-old dinosaur to be auctioned in Paris
Back in 1980, father-and-son scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez first proposed that the dinosaurs were killed off by an asteroid strike that shrouded the world in dust.
Their claim was initially met with some scepticism -- until a decade later when the massive crater of Chicxulub was found in what is now the Yucatan Peninsula on the Gulf of Mexico.
Now, scientists largely agree that Chicxulub was to blame.
But the idea that it was sulphur, rather than dust, that caused the impact winter has become ""very popular"" in recent years, Ozgur Karatekin, a researcher at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, told AFP.
Study co-author Karatekin said this was because the dust from the impact was thought to be the wrong size to stay in the atmosphere for long enough.
For the study, the international team of researchers was able to measure dust particles thought to be from right after the asteroid struck.
- 'Catastrophic collapse' -
The particles were found at the Tanis fossil site in the US state of North Dakota.
Though 3,000 kilometres (1,865 miles) away from the crater, the site has preserved a number of remarkable finds believed to be dated from directly after the asteroid impact in sediment layers of an ancient lake.
The dust particles were around 0.8 to 8.0 micrometres -- just the right size to stick around in the atmosphere for up to 15 years, the researchers said.
Entering this data into climate models similar to those used for current-day Earth, the researchers determined that dust likely played a far greater role in the mass extinction than had previously been thought.
Out of all the material that was shot into the atmosphere by the asteroid, they estimated that it was 75 percent dust, 24 percent sulphur and one percent soot.
The dust particles ""totally shut down photosynthesis"" in plants for at least a year, causing a ""catastrophic collapse"" of life, Karatekin said.
Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin and not involved in the research, told AFP that the study was another interesting effort to answer the ""hot question"" -- what drove the impact winter -- but did not provide the definitive answer.
He emphasised that discovering what happened during the world's last mass extinction event was important not just for understanding the past, but also the future.
""Maybe we can better predict our own mass extinction that we're probably in the middle of,"" Gulick said.

SCIENCE,NASA's big update on Osiris mission: ‘Struggling to open containers but…’,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/nasas-big-update-on-osiris-mission-struggling-to-open-containers-but-101698163871785.html,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said that its team processing the sample retrieved from asteroid Bennu under the OSIRIS-REx mission has sucessfully removed and collected 70.3 grams (or 2.48 ounces) of rocks and dust.
This is more than the agency's goal of bringing at least 60 grams to Earth, it said.
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx, the first US mission to collect a sample from an asteroid, delivered rocks and dust from asteroid Bennu to Earth on September 24.
The material from Bennu – which the spacecraft collected from the asteroid's surface in 2020 – will offer generations of scientists a window into the time when the Sun and planets were forming about 4.5 billion years ago.
On October 20, NASA said that the sample processed so far includes the rocks and dust found on the outside of the sampler head, as well as a portion of the bulk sample from inside the head, which was accessed through the head’s mylar flap.

The US space agency said that some additional material remains inside the sampler head, called the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, or TAGSAM, which the teams at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) are struggling to open.
“In the last week, the team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston changed its approach to opening the TAGSAM head, which contained the bulk of the rocks and dust collected by the spacecraft in 2020,” the space agency said in a blog post. “After multiple attempts at removal, the team discovered two of the 35 fasteners on the TAGSAM head could not be removed with the current tools approved for use in the OSIRIS-REx glovebox. The team has been working to develop and implement new approaches to extract the material inside the head, while continuing to keep the sample safe and pristine.”
It said that the team will spend the next few weeks developing and practicing a new procedure to remove the remaining asteroid sample from the TAGSAM sampler head while simultaneously processing the material that was collected this week.
“The OSIRIS-REx science team will also proceed with its plan to characterize the extracted material and begin analysis of the bulk sample obtained so far,” the US space agency pointed out.

SCIENCE,"Drought in Brazil's Amazon reveals some 2,000-year-old engravings",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drought-in-brazils-amazon-reveals-some-2-000-year-old-engravings-101697945433222.html,"An extreme drought in parts of the Amazon has led to a dramatic drop in river water levels, exposing dozens of usually submerged rock formations with carvings of human forms that may date back some 2,000 years.
Livia Ribeiro, a longtime resident of the Amazon's largest city, Manaus, said she heard about the rock engravings from friends and wanted to check them out.
""I thought it was a lie ... I had never seen this. I've lived in Manaus for 27 years,"" said Ribeiro, an administrator, after viewing the dazzling relics.
The rock carvings are not usually visible because they are covered by the waters of the Negro River, whose flow recorded its lowest level in 121 years last week.

The surfacing of the engravings on the riverbank have delighted scientists and the general public alike but also raised unsettling questions.
""We come, we look at (the engravings) and we think they are beautiful. But at the same time, it is worrying... I also think about whether this river will exist in 50 or 100 years,"" Ribeiro said.
Drought in Brazil's Amazon has drastically reduced river levels in recent weeks, affecting a region that depends on a maze of waterways for transportation and supplies.
The Brazilian government has sent emergency aid to the area, where normally bustling riverbanks are dry, littered with stranded boats.
According to experts, the dry season has worsened this year due to El Nino, an irregular climate pattern over the Pacific Ocean that disrupts normal weather, adding to the effect of climate change.

The engravings comprise an archaeological site of ""great relevance,"" said Jaime Oliveira of the Brazilian Institute of Historical Heritage (Iphan).
They are at a site known as Praia das Lajes and were first seen in 2010, during another period of drought not as severe as the current one.
The rock carvings appear against a backdrop of dense jungle, with the low brownish waters of the Negro River flowing nearby.
Most of the engravings are of human faces, some of them rectangular and others oval, with smiles or grim expressions.
""The site expresses emotions, feelings, it is an engraved rock record, but it has something in common with current works of art,"" said Oliveira.
For Beatriz Carneiro, historian and member of Iphan, Praia das Lajes has an ""inestimable"" value in understanding the first people who inhabited the region, a field still little explored.
""Unhappily it is now reappearing with the worsening of the drought,"" Carneiro said. “Having our rivers back (flooded) and keeping the engravings submerged will help preserve them, even more than our work.”

The vehicle is 34.9 metres tall and has a lift-off weight of 44 tonnes. The structure of the TV-D1 flight is a single-walled unpressurised aluminium structure with a simulated thermal protection system.
The crew module, a habitable space with an Earth-like environment in space for the crew, consists of a pressurised metallic 'inner structure' and an unpressurised 'external structure' with 'thermal protection systems'. It is also equipped with crew interfaces, life support system, avionics and deceleration systems and is also designed for re-entry to ensure the safety of the crew during the descent till touchdown.
The entire test flight sequence is expected to be brief as the Test Vehicle Abort Mission (TV-D1) would have launched the crew escape system and crew module at an altitude of 17 km which was expected to make a safe touchdown in the sea, about 10 km from Sriharikota on India's eastern coast. They would have later be retrieved by the Navy from the Bay of Bengal.
According to ISRO, the success of the test flight will set the stage for the remaining qualification tests including around 20 major tests with 3 uncrewed missions of the Human Rated Launch Vehicle (HLVM3), subsequently leading to the launch of the Gaganyaan mission.
The highly anticipated Gaganyaan mission aims to send humans into space on a Low Earth Orbit at an altitude of 400 km for a three-day mission, with a safe return to Earth scheduled for 2025, thus making India the fourth nation to launch a manned spaceflight mission after the US, Russia, and China.
Ahead of the launch, the crew module underwent various tests at ISRO centres before it was integrated into the launch complex in Sriharikota.

SCIENCE,First pill for dengue shows promise in human challenge trial,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/first-pill-for-dengue-shows-promise-in-human-challenge-trial-101697789713273.html,"A pill for dengue fever developed by Johnson & Johnson appeared to protect against a form of the virus in a handful of patients in a small human challenge trial in the United States, according to data presented by the company on Friday.
There are currently no specific treatments for dengue, a growing disease threat, the company said ahead of presentation of the data at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting in Chicago.
“It is the first ever to show antiviral activity against dengue,” Marnix Van Loock, who oversees emerging pathogens research for J&J’s Janssen division, said of the drug.
In human challenge trials, researchers intentionally expose healthy volunteers to a pathogen to test a vaccine or treatment, or better understand the disease they cause.
Dengue fever, while often asymptomatic, is also known as “break bone fever” for the severity of the joint pain and spasms that some patients experience. It has long been a scourge across much of Asia and Latin America, causing millions of infections each year and tens of thousands of deaths, and is likely to spread further as climate change makes more areas hospitable for the mosquitoes that spread it, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist Jeremy Farrar said earlier this month.
In the trial done with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 10 volunteers were given a high dose of the J&J pill five days before being injected with a type of dengue. They continued to take the pill for 21 days afterwards.
Six of the 10 showed no detectable dengue virus in their blood after being exposed to the pathogen, as well as no signs that their immune system had responded to infection by the virus over 85 days of monitoring.
The five people in a placebo group, who were also injected with dengue, all showed detectable virus when tested. Trial participants received standard care from medical professionals where necessary, and the virus used was a weakened version to minimise symptoms.
The positive early data supports ongoing Phase II trials of the pill to prevent the four different types of dengue in a real world-setting where the disease is common, J&J said. The next step will be testing it as a treatment.
The drug works by blocking the action of two viral proteins, preventing the virus from making copies of itself. It was well-tolerated by all trial participants, J&J said.
A key question for the future will be ensuring access to the new drug, if it works on a larger scale, in many of the low- and middle-income countries where it is most needed, an echo of the challenge for the dengue vaccine the WHO backed earlier this month.
“We’re working on it,” said Van Loock, adding that it was early days.

SCIENCE,What 'ring of fire' eclipse looked like from space? NASA shares images,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/what-ring-of-fire-eclipse-looked-like-from-space-nasa-shares-images-101697639267900.html,"A satellite image capturing the 'Ring of Fire' eclipse has been released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), revealing its shadow as it cast itself upon Earth.
“About 15 lakh kilometres from Earth, the shadow, or umbra, from the Moon was seen falling across the southeastern coast of Texas,” NASA said sharing the image on Tuesday.
This Saturday, a celestial alignment occurred when the Moon aligned itself with the Sun and Earth, producing an annular solar eclipse. This spectacular phenomenon was visible to billions of onlookers in the United States, Mexico, and several countries across Central and South America as the lunar shadow enveloped the Sun's radiant rays.

The image was captured during the eclipse by NASA's EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) aboard DSCVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory). This sensor is located at Lagrange Point 1, where the Indian Space Research Organisation has sent the Aditya L1 solar probe.
The US space agency also shared a picture of the annular eclipse as seen from the International Space Station. See below:

This eclipse is classified as an annular eclipse, which transpires when the Moon moves in front of the Sun but remains at a distance from Earth that prevents total obscuration. During an annular eclipse, the Moon is positioned at or close to its farthest point from Earth, also known as its apogee. This relative distance causes the Moon to appear smaller in the sky, consequently revealing the Sun's edges in a striking red-orange ring, hence its moniker, the ""Ring of Fire,"" according to NASA.
The next annular solar eclipse visible from the United States is slated for June 21, 2039. However, a total solar eclipse is on the horizon, expected to darken skies from Texas to Maine on Monday, April 8, 2024.

SCIENCE,ISRO 'very busy' with various exploration missions: What S Somanath said,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/isro-very-busy-with-various-exploration-missions-what-s-somanath-said-101697389158003.html,"ISRO has lined up a series of exploration missions including to Mars, Venus and to the Moon again, apart from the maiden human spaceflight programme, Chairman S Somanath said on Sunday. The space agency also has drawn up plans to launch missions for studying climate and weather conditions of the Earth, the space agency chief said, speaking to reporters.
Besides, ISRO is also working on regular scientific missions including communication, remote sensing satellites, Somanath, who is also the Secretary of the Department of Space, said here.
Speaking about the Gaganyaan programme, he said the maiden TV-D1 test flight is scheduled for October 21. Elaborating about the upcoming missions undertaken by the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency, he said, “We have exploration missions. We have plans to go to Mars, Venus, again sometime to the Moon. We also have programmes to look at the climate and weather of Earth.”
Stressing that the scientists at ISRO would be focused on taking up regular missions like launching satellites for communications and remote sensing, he said scientific missions are also in the pipeline to look at issues like aeronomy, thermal imaging, and climate change impact assessment.
“So many things are there and we are very busy doing all of this,” he said. To a query about whether scientists were able to receive any kind of response from the Vikram lander of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which successfully made a soft-landing on the surface of the Moon on August 23, he said Vikram had done its job very well during the lunar day (equivalent of 14 Earth days) at which time it was programmed to perform its functions.
“It is happily sleeping on the Moon. It has done its job very well. Maybe if it wishes to wake up, let it wake up. Until then, we will wait,” he said. ISRO made efforts to re-establish communication with rover Pragyan and lander Vikram after they were put into sleep mode in September following the onset of night on the Moon.
""No signals have been received from them. Efforts to establish contact will continue,"" ISRO had said. After the historic landing on August 23, lander Vikram and rover Pragyan performed different tasks on the lunar surface, including detecting the presence of sulphur and recording relative temperature. About ISRO's maiden mission to study the Sun, Somanath said the spacecraft is ‘very healthy’ and is on a 110-day long journey to the Lagrange point L1 and is expected to reach the intended destination by “middle of January.”
“It is a long journey. It is almost 110 days of journey and it has covered some distance now. We corrected a little bit of its trajectory, because early correction is important to reach the L1 point. After tracking, we find it is going in the right direction towards the L1 point,” he said.
Observing that the rocket is on a ‘complex travel’, Somanath said, “It takes almost another 70-75 days further to reach. By the middle of January, it will reach there. After that, we will make some corrections to make it enter into the Halo orbit at the L1 point.”
“After that instruments will be switched on and it will start doing the scientific data streaming. Currently, everything is very healthy on Aditya L1,” he said.

SCIENCE,Skygazers watch 'Ring of Fire' eclipse over Western Hemisphere,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/skygazers-watch-ring-of-fire-eclipse-over-western-hemisphere-101697347228792.html,"Skygazers across the Americas turned their faces upwards Saturday for a rare celestial event: an annular solar eclipse.
A crowd of people wearing protective eyewear gathered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, one of many across the western United States watching as the Moon passed between the Sun and Earth at its furthest point from our planet.
Since it is so distant, it did not cover the Sun completely, creating a ""ring of fire"" effect that brought cheers from the crowd in Albuquerque.
""It's majestic. We're in awe,"" said one viewer, Shannon Cozad.
In the course of just a few hours the most striking ""path of the annularity"" was crossing a handful of major cities, including Eugene, Oregon and San Antonio, Texas, with partial eclipse phases lasting an hour or two before and after.
""It's kind of like a black hole,"" said Mubaraq Sokunbi, an excited eight-year-old who was at a hot air balloon festival in Albuquerque with his family. ""The moon covers the sun and then there's a ring around it.""
At any given location, the eclipse was visible from between 30 seconds and five minutes -- but people were urged to take safety precautions and use solar viewing glasses, and never regular sunglasses, to preserve their vision.
The eclipse crossed into Mexico and Central America, then into South America through Colombia and northern Brazil before ending at sunset in the Atlantic Ocean.
At the Bogota Planetarium, a crowd gathered around noon, holding their breath for the clouds to clear.
When they did -- and in time to see the eclipse -- some observers shed tears, overwhelmed by emotion.
""It was at first distressing not to be able to see it, then very moving"" when it appeared, Xiomara Cifuentes, a 41-year-old civil servant who came with her husband and their three children, told AFP.
""It will be a beautiful memory,"" she added.
It was ""a pretty beautiful moment... an indescribable thing, without words,"" said Jhoan Vinazco, a 25-year-old university student who had never seen an eclipse before.
In the town of Penonome, Panama, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from Panama City, Carlos Ramirez watched the eclipse dressed as an astronaut -- something he dreamed of becoming as a child.
""I found the event here in Panama spectacular,"" the 55-year-old tour guide told AFP.
The event also served as a dress rehearsal ahead of a total eclipse set for April 2024.
Both eclipses are going to be ""absolutely breathtaking for science,"" said Madhulika Guhathakurta, a heliophysics program scientist at NASA.
Solar eclipses have a noticeable effect on the upper atmosphere, such as the ionosphere, which is full of charged particles and responsible for reflecting and refracting radio waves.
""Although the atmospheric effects of solar eclipses have been studied for over 50 years, many unanswered questions remain,"" said Guhathakurta.
To study these effects, NASA planned three rocket launches on Saturday from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to gather data on the electric and magnetic fields, electron density and temperature.
A total eclipse took place in 2017 in the United States. After next April's total eclipse, there will not be another until 2044, while the next annular eclipse will be in 2046.

SCIENCE,ISRO to hold more test under Gaganyaan after maiden test: S Somanath,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/isro-to-hold-more-test-under-gaganyaan-after-maiden-test-s-somanath-101697347222732.html,"ISRO will conduct three more test vehicle missions under the ambitious Gaganyaan programme after the maiden TV-D1 test flight, which is scheduled on October 21, the space agency's chairman S Somanath has said.
The Gaganyaan project envisages a demonstration of the human spaceflight capability by launching a human crew to an orbit of 400 km and bringing them safely back to earth by landing in Indian sea waters.
The test vehicle development flight (TV-D1) will be conducted at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh to test the crew module that is scheduled to house Indian astronauts during the human spaceflight late next year.
""The first test vehicle flight (of the Gaganyaan mission) will be conducted on October 21. After that we have planned for three more test missions, D2, D3, D4. We will hold thorough tests during the test flight sequence,"" Somanath, who is also the secretary, Department of Space, told reporters in Madurai on Saturday. He was here to participate in a couple of events in Rameswaram.
TV-D1 involves launching the crew module to outer space, bringing it back to earth and recovering it after touchdown in the Bay of Bengal.
Recently, Union Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh said the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency would carry out the first of several test flights ahead of the Gaganyaan maiden mission on October 21 at Sriharikota.
To a query about the Aditya-L1 programme, the maiden solar mission undertaken by ISRO, Somanath expressed hope that the spacecraft will reach the Lagrange point (L1) in the middle of January 2024.
""We will insert it in the L1 point and undertake various scientific experiments from that point,"" he said.
Last week, ISRO scientists performed a trajectory correction manoeuvre on the Aditya L1 spacecraft. The spacecraft was launched by a PSLV-C57 rocket on September 2.
On the setting up of another launch pad in Kulasekarapattinam in Tuticorin district, he said ISRO would be able to avail several benefits from that launch pad as it would be useful for launching smaller rockets and to serve private players.
""…right now bigger rockets like PSLV need to take a turn towards the southward direction above Sri Lanka since the launch pad is in the east (in Sriharikota). Whereas in Kulasekarapattinam, we don’t need to make rockets to make that turn as they will already be facing southward,"" he said.
""Smaller Satellite Launch Vehicles and private players will be able to use that launch pad (in Kulasekarapattinam). Right now, the land is in the acquisition stage. It will take two years for completion,"" Somanath said.

SCIENCE,'Ring of fire' solar eclipse today: Where to witness the rare phenomenon?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-live-updates-today-where-to-witness-the-rare-phenomenon-101697261128877.html,"A rare “ring of fire” eclipse of the sun cuts across the Americas on Saturday, stretching from Oregon to Brazil.
For the small towns and cities along its narrow path, there was a mix of excitement, worries about the weather and concerns they'd be overwhelmed by visitors flocking to see the celestial event, also called an annular solar eclipse.
Unlike a total solar eclipse, the moon doesn't completely cover the sun during a ring of fire eclipse. When the moon lines up between Earth and the sun, it leaves a bright, blazing border.
Saturday's path: Oregon, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas in the U.S., with a sliver of California, Arizona and Colorado. Next: Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Brazil. Much of the rest of the Western Hemisphere gets a partial eclipse.
Viewing all depends on clear skies — part of the U.S. path could see clouds. NASA and other groups planned to livestream it.
With a chance of rain in its forecast, the small town of Reedsport near Oregon's Pacific Coast moved its eclipse festival inside so that a bounce house and games wouldn't get soaked in the mud.
""But we're still hoping that we might get a glimpse of it,” said city official Rosa Solano.
Weather was less of a concern in tiny Baker, Nevada, where the population hovers around 100. Inn and general store owner Liz Woolsey made T-shirts and planned a slate of activities including a drum circle and a dance party. Her seven rooms have been booked for over a year.
“For a little place, we're putting on a good show,"" said Woolsey, who became an eclipse enthusiast after seeing the 2017 total solar eclipse that swept the U.S. from coast to coast.
Tens of thousands could get a double treat in Albuquerque, New Mexico. For the city's annual air balloon fiesta, which ends this weekend, hundreds of colourful hot air balloons lift off around dawn, hours before the eclipse briefly dims the skies.
Colombia's Tatacoa desert was playing host to astronomers helping a group of visually impaired people experience the eclipse through raised maps and temperature changes as the moon blots out the sun.
At the Cancun Planetarium, young visitors built box projectors to indirectly and safely view the ring of fire. The ancient Maya — who called eclipses “broken sun” — may have used dark volcanic glass to protect their eyes, said archaeologist Arturo Montero of Tepeyac University in Mexico City.
Towns and national parks in the path braced for a huge throngs. Officials in Oregon's Klamath County urged residents to stock up on groceries and fill their gas tanks in case traffic backs up on its two-lane highways. Utah's Bryce Canyon expected Saturday to be the park's busiest day of the year, spokesperson Peter Densmore said. Brazil's Pedra da Boca state park, known for its rocky outcrops for climbing and rappelling was also expecting crowds.
The entire eclipse — from the moment the moon starts to obscure the sun until it's back to normal — is 2 1/2 to three hours at any given spot. The ring of fire portion lasts from three to five minutes, depending on location.
Next April, a total solar eclipse will crisscross the U.S. in the opposite direction. That one will begin in Mexico and go from Texas to New England before ending in eastern Canada.
The next ring of fire eclipse is in October next year at the southernmost tip of South America. Antarctica gets one in 2026. It will be 2039 before another ring of fire is visible in the U.S., and Alaska will be the only state in its direct path.

SCIENCE,Claudia Goldin wins the Nobel prize in economics,https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/claudia-goldin-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-economics-101697202450091.html,"On the morning of October 9th, the National Bureau of Economic Research circulated a working paper to economists around the world entitled “Why Women Won”. In the paper, Claudia Goldin of Harvard University documents how women achieved equal rights in American workplaces and families. Rather fittingly, a few hours later, Ms Goldin was announced as the winner of this year’s economics Nobel prize, for advancing “our understanding of women’s labour-market outcomes”.

Having been the first woman to be granted tenure at Harvard’s economics department, Ms Goldin is now the third woman to have won the subject’s Nobel prize. Taken together, her research provides a comprehensive history of gender labour-market inequality over the past 200 years. In telling this history, she has overturned assumptions about both historical gender relations and what is required to achieve greater equality in the present day.
Before Ms Goldin’s work, economists had thought that economic growth led to a more level playing field. In fact, Ms Goldin showed, the Industrial Revolution drove married women out of the labour force, as production moved from home to factory. In research published in 1990 she demonstrated that it was only in the 20th century, when service-sector jobs proliferated and high-school education developed, that the more familiar pattern emerged. The relationship between the size of Western economies and female-labour-force participation is u-shaped—a classic Goldin result.
Ms Goldin’s research has busted other myths, too. Lawrence Katz, her colleague and husband, marvels at her ability to trawl archives to fill gaps in the historical data on women’s work. Simple statistics, such as the female employment rate, were mismeasured because when surveyed, women might respond “I’m a housewife”, notes Ms Goldin, even if they managed the family business. Once corrected, the employment rate for white married women, for example, was 12.5% in 1890—five times greater than previously thought.

For the third and most substantial drop, in the late 20th century, Ms Goldin emphasises the role of expectations. If a young woman has more say over when and whether she will have a child, and more confidence that women can work in a wide range of jobs, she may invest more in the future, such as by staying in school for longer. In work published in 2002 Ms Goldin and Mr Katz detailed the example of the contraceptive pill, which was approved in 1960, and gave women more control over decisions about children. Between 1967 and 1979 the share of 20- and 21-year-old women who expected to be employed at 35 jumped from 35% to 80%.
Expectations also matter for employers. Although the pay gap narrowed in the early 1900s, the portion driven by discrimination, rather than job type, grew. An important factor, says Ms Goldin, was changes in how payment was decided. Wages used to be tied to output—how many clothes were knitted, for instance. But after industrialisation, workers were increasingly paid periodically, in part because measuring an individual’s output became trickier. Therefore more ambiguous factors grew in importance, such as ideas about how long a worker would stay on the job. This penalised women, who were expected to quit when they had children.
Since around 2005 the wage gap has hardly budged. Here Ms Goldin’s work questions popular narratives that continue to blame wage discrimination. Instead, in a book published in 2021, Ms Goldin blames “greedy” jobs, such as being a consultant or lawyer, which offer increasing returns to long (and uncertain) hours.
She explains how such work interacts with the so-called parenthood penalty. “Let’s say there are two lawyers, equally brilliant,” explains Ms Goldin. Once children arrive, “they realise that they both can’t work these gruelling hours.” Women spend more time raising children, which is why the gender pay gap tends to open up after a first child. Both partners could take on less demanding jobs, but then the couple would earn less as a unit, she explains.
Ms Goldin’s research holds lessons for economists and policymakers. For the former group, it shows the importance of history. Ms Goldin’s prize is the first economics Nobel awarded for work largely in economic history since Robert Fogel, her former adviser, triumphed in 1993. Before Ms Goldin’s research, many academics considered questions about historical gender pay gaps to be unanswerable because of a paucity of data. Yet she has repeatedly demonstrated that digging through historical archives allows researchers to credibly answer big questions previously thought beyond their reach.
For policymakers, Ms Goldin’s research demonstrates that fixes for gender inequality vary depending on time and place. In early 20th-century America, companies barred married women from obtaining or retaining employment. A policy response came with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned such behaviour. Today, wage gaps persist because of greedy jobs and parental norms, rather than because of straightforward employer discrimination. In the past, Ms Goldin has suggested more flexibility in the workplace could be a solution to the problem. Perhaps working out how to achieve it will be her next act.
